"anomalies cease to occur. For this reason, all harvesting necessary for "
"sustained use of the CFR must be complete before the Fracture runs its "

"\n"
"Paul Serene – Project Director\n"
"\n"
"With a track record of extremely profitable business ventures behind him, Paul Serene joined Riverport University in 2010 to head one of the most significant physics research projects the university has ever seen. He is the youngest project director in the history of our university, and by far the most successful to date. His involvement has encouraged a flood of high profile investments that resulted in the extremely ambitious, yet-unrevealed quantum physics project referred to as Project Promenade.\n"
"\n"
"In his own words:\n"
"\n"
"“I'm not a scientist myself, and thus it may come as a surprise to many that I fought to obtain the position as project director development here at the university. For me it’s a dream come true. Growing up my best friend was the brother of renowned quantum physicist William Joyce. I've always been fascinated by William’s work, and his publications from 1997 to 1999 were groundbreaking for the scientific community. As a businessman I’ve been able to help shape a path to create practical applications for William’s work by building on the foundation that he created with a group of immensely talented physicists. That was the basis for Project Promenade, and the results have been absolutely revolutionary.”\n"

As a professor at Riverport University, Dr. Kim was praised for his tireless devotion to his field and his students. Both Dr. William Joyce and Dr. Elton Meyer, whose research efforts eventually led to the discovery of the Meyer-Joyce Field, were his students. He later made a name for himself as the director of Monarch Solutions’ Physics Research Division. While maintaining this position he also contributed heavily to research at Riverport University, lending his services to the development of Project Promenade, based on his students' discoveries. which he continued to work on until the time of his death."

"I asked, and I’ve got confirmation from our supervisor that Dr. William Joyce’s security clearance needs to be revoked. So yeah, the time for termination is scheduled for 4:20am, OCT 9 precisely. No idea why that exact time, must be a contract thing. The guy was consulting on Promenade but he lost his shit in front of investors a few days ago. I was the one dragging him out. It got pretty crazy. He was yelling about how some lady warned him this would happen. No idea what the hell he was about. If it was up to me, I’d cut his clearance immediately, but screw it, they don’t want my advice. I don’t want to get involved in any of that Monarch stuff anyway, let’s just do our jobs. So just keep an eye open for Dr. Joyce until then, OK?\n"

"FROM: AMY FERRERO\n"
"DATE: Oct. 6, 2016 – 3:04pm\n"
"SUBJECT: Library protest info\n"
"\n"
"So, here’s a bunch of things we need to do before the protest.\n"
"\n"
"We only have a few days before it’s happening, and we’re not remotely ready, so we gotta hustle if we’re gonna make this work. Unless somebody protests, I’m gonna be coordinating things, because right now we’re running around like headless chickens here and this is gonna be a disaster if we don’t get our act together. (If somebody else wants to do this, let me know!)\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"PREP BEFORE THE PROTEST:\n"
"\n"
"BANNERS/SIGNS: Rita and Tommy got the supplies, but that’s as far as we got with this. Since you two have them, you’re on banner duty. Make them big and splashy. (No profanity, we want them to be able to show them on TV!) Make extra ones, we can hand them out! We can’t have too many.\n"
"\n"
"FIRST AID: We need to have some kind of first aid ready just in case something goes wrong. Abe, you’re trained, so I’d like you to run with this. Get a couple of other people to help. (Let me know if you run into a wall with that, I can guilt them into doing it.) I think we’ve got plenty of supplies from the last time, and they should all still be good, but if we need something, we’ve got about $300 we can use for this. And let’s make sure we’ve got plenty of water bottles to hand out, too.\n"
"\n"
"PRESS RELEASE: I got this; I’ll send a draft of it along tomorrow so we can do a round of feedback. Jordan, I know you’ve got those media contacts, so if you have time to talk about it and sex it up as required, so we can get maximum exposure, that’d be awesome. Right now we’re being kind of ignored. I know that’ll change once we’re underway, but I’d like for the media to have this in their actual schedules.\n"
"\n"
"POSTERS: This is pretty much taken care of, lots of them around already, and we’ve got social media full of that stuff now. I’d like to spread them out beyond the university, though. I’m gonna be going to Port Donnelly tonight, so that’s one area taken care of. So if anybody else can take a little Riverport tour and put some more of them up, let me know.\n"
"\n"
"UNIVERSITY LIAISON: We need to keep Riverport U calm. If they feel like we’re stepping on their toes too much, we’ll be fighting on two fronts. The good news is, this is actually the one thing I feel we’ve got completely under control; Thelma’s been talking to them from the start. So if anybody gets any static from any university rep, don’t argue and don’t escalate, just call Thelma, she’s got it.\n"
"\n"
"TRANSPORT: I’ve got all of the fliers and the PA system and tents and everything else at my place, but my car’s still busted, so somebody’s gonna have to pick me up on the morning of the 7th. I nominate Gary, because a) he’s got that SUV so he’s got the space and b) Gary’s built like a brick shithouse and those boxes of fliers and the speakers are heavy. Also, I love to watch a man work because the matriarchy is 100% real and I’m a part of the problem.\n"
"\n"
"It’d be great if somebody could swing by and get the banners and signs from Rita and Tommy, too. Abe, I know you’re gonna be busy with the other stuff, but do you think Gail could do it? I know she’s not really a part of this, but all she’d have to do is drive, she doesn’t have to be at the protest itself.\n"
"\n"
"DURING THE PROTEST:\n"
"\n"
"We all know how the actual protest is gonna go, so I’m not too worried about it. We’ll have speeches and whatnot, some chants, the usual thing. Jordan’s taking care of all the on-stage stuff; he’ll introduce speakers and generally work the crowd. Thelma’s organizing the actual program, so anything you need to get on the agenda, if somebody wants to speak, whatever, Thelma’s in charge of that. If she doesn’t know about it, it won’t happen. (So don’t tell Jordan, tell Thelma!)\n"
"\n"
"There’s a thing I want to be really clear about: we have to keep this peaceful! The last thing we need is give Monarch an excuse to start anything. This is all about public image – they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do with the library, and unless the university steps in, the building’s going down. We all know that. I’m hoping we can stop that, but even if we can’t, we can make people realize what Monarch is doing to Riverport. That only works if we look like reasonable people and they look like, well, the corporate assholes they are. Camilla, you’ve done this kind of thing before, so I trust you to keep an eye on everything. It’ll be tricky, because campus security is a subsidiary of Monarch, so if there’s a problem, I don’t know if it’s going to be in their best interests to actually do their job properly.\n"
"\n"
"To complicate things, people are gonna get wasted. I know we’re saying they shouldn’t, but we can’t really stop it. All we can do is try to steer people who get too drunk out of there, and please, guys, everybody organizing this has to have their heads on straight or it’ll just turn into a mess. Camilla, that’s on you, too. I know you’ve got your own crew and I trust you to handle this, but if you feel you need a hand, ask anybody, we’ll drop whatever we’re doing and help you out. (EVERYBODY, DO WHAT CAMILLA SAYS.)\n"
"\n"
"I guess that’s everything for now. Let me know if there’s a problem with any of this. We can do this, we just gotta hustle!\n"

"\n"
"1. Execute all witnesses.\n"
"Any witnesses to our actions at the university are to be executed without prejudice. Said witnesses have been transported to the Ground Zero operation. We simply cannot afford any loose threads at this point in our operation. Perform routine questioning and then execute. Civilians who did not directly witness our operation but were present may be intimidated into silence. Such cases will be evaluated by supervisors in charge of the clean-up operation. If there’s any doubt as to the effectiveness of softer methods, do not hesitate to execute. We’re not taking any chances.\n"
"\n"
"2. Assist in core transportation\n"
"The time machine core has been airlifted from the university to the drydock near the Ground Zero operation. All available personnel must assist in prepping the core for covert ground transport to Monarch Tower for installation.\n"
"\n"
"3. Find Jack Joyce\n"
"Jack Joyce’s transport has gone missing shortly after reaching the Ground Zero operation. Liam Burke is heading a search party to find him. If you possess any information that might assist in his capture, report to me directly. \n"
"\n"
"4. Chronon harvesting\n"
"Until Jack Joyce is found we are assigning additional security personnel to protect the chronon harvesting operation and Ground Zero perimeters. Teams have been stationed to patrol surrounding supply warehouses as well. \n"
"\n"
"5. Monarch gala prep\n"
"If your role is not impacted by the previous four directives then you are to assist in prep for the Monarch Gala tonight, which is still moving forward as planned. More information to follow.\n"
"\n"
"Any questions regarding security can be directed to Liam Burke. Any other questions should be addressed to your supervisor."

"Just got word from Martin Hatch. Apparently our almighty overlord (jk) Paul Serene has given the greenlight to our PR proposal. We’re implementing a broad PR strategy to deal with the public reaction to the university operation. That means that you will all be working with me directly for the next several hours whether you like it or not (that’s directed at you, DAVE). \n"
"\n"
"First up – news broadcast. I’ve skimmed through the list of witnesses pulled from the university and marked the best candidate to deliver our false confession – AMY FERRERO. Perfect mix of hot and sad puppy. Media will eat her up. Green screen and recording equipment are being prepped as we speak. Time is of the essence. I need that video shot and delivered to me within the next half hour in order to get it to media in time, so get her ready for her fifteen minutes of fame. We’re gonna be pinning all this on Jack Joyce, that wacky little domestic terrorist rascal. Somebody needs to take the fall, right? \n"
"\n"
"The “device that Monarch stole from the university but Charlie isn’t allowed to know any further details about due to his security clearance” has been airlifted to the Ground Zero operation. I’m arranging covert transport to its final destination at Monarch Tower. I’ll be your eye in the sky monitoring traffic to make sure the route is clear. Also, I want my security clearance upgraded once this shit calms down. Level 4? Bullshit. \n"

"Still searching for Joyce. Transport disappeared after entering the ground zero perimeter. Digging through our hundreds of camera feeds to see if anything comes up. Even if we can’t locate him ourselves, it’s not like Joyce can go anywhere without somebody spotting him once Ferrero does her thing. Liam Burke is leading the search party on the ground. $5 to anybody who can make Burke smile.\n"

"It’s all rumors and conjecture from what I hear. I wasn’t at the university op but there’s no way Joyce took out all those guards. He’s just some random guy, not a trained assassin. The stories floating around make it sound like he’s shooting laser beams out of his goddamn asshole. Anyway, they got Liam Burke hunting him down right now, so I think it’s safe to say Joyce is fucked. \n"
"\n"
"Off the record, I heard Paul Serene has been investigating a potential traitor within Monarch. Somebody’s been accessing all kinds of confidential information. Remember that research Dr. Amaral was doing to find a permanent cure for Serene’s sickness? Rumor has it somebody sabotaged the tests. Had to start over. Just a few weeks later the uni op goes sour. Willing to bet the same person sabotaged us there.\n"

I’ve been allowed a lot of freedom to come and go in my position, but it comes at a cost of very low clearance. Most members of the team know something I don’t and they’re not eager to share. Tomorrow’s operation is more than a simple retrieval mission. There are dates and times marked with detailed events that are expected to come to pass. I’ve seen charts with “Fracture – 4:15am” labeled.  It’s way too much detail for a plan, it’s like it’s all been mapped out. How?\n"

I can’t sit back and watch if there’s even a chance that this could put Emily in danger. I need to know more. Serene won’t answer my messages. Hatch is a closed book.

"\n"
"We haven’t talked too much but I’m one of Serene’s guys from Reaper Squad. Working around all this time tech stuff (or chronon tech you call it I guess?) got me real inspired so I started writing a screenplay. There’s a lot of science talk in here so I want a scientist to check it and make sure it kind of makes sense. Would you mind taking a look? Thanks!\n"
"\n"
"Here is the first half:\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"TIME KNIFE\n"
"Written By Bruce Livingstone\n"
"ACT ONE\n"
"INT. OFFICE – NIGHT \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE SAVAGE stands in his office. He is sexually attractive.\n"
"\n"
"Somebody knocks on Bruce’s door and he opens it. It’s a SCIENTIST LADY. She looks like a librarian with glasses but she is actually a scientist. You can tell because she has a lab coat.\n"
"\n"
"LADY SCIENTIST:\n"
"Help me.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"Okay.\n"
"\n"
"LADY SCIENTIST: \n"
"Take this knife because some bad apples are trying to steal it and it is very important.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Okay.\n"
"\n"
"LADY SCIENTIST:\n"
"What is your name handsome? \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I’m Bruce. Let’s shake hands.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce and Lady Scientist shake hands. \n"
"\n"
"LADY SCIENTIST: \n"
"Wow. You almost broke my hand with that handshake. You are definitely a tough guy. \n"
"\n"
"She is impressed with Bruce’s strength. She looks at his large biceps like they are delicious pieces of ham but she doesn’t want to eat them. \n"
"\n"
"LADY SCIENTIST: \n"
"Here is the knife.\n"
"\n"
"The Lady Scientist hands Bruce the knife. It looks mostly like a knife but also like a time machine because it is both a knife and a time machine but Bruce doesn’t know that yet. \n"
"\n"
"GOONS break through the windows and shoot the scientist lady. She dies.\n"
"\n"
"SCIENTIST LADY:\n"
"Avenge me.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Okay. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce kills the goons with his legs by doing lots of kicking at them. They are dead real quick.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"Looks like I got a LEG UP on you guys. \n"
"\n"
"The audience probably laughs here so Bruce waits to deliver his next line for around five seconds so that everybody has calmed down.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"What is so special about this knife?\n"
"\n"
"Bruce stabs the knife into his chair. The chair disappears. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"The chair disappeared.\n"
"\n"
"He looks at a picture on his wall which is a big photograph from 1932 with lots of people from 1932 in it. Bruce’s chair is in the picture.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Interesting. My chair traveled back in time to 1932 when I stabbed it. When I stab things they travel through time. That explains why this knife looks like a knife but also like a time machine, because it is both. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce’s real goofy friend from across the hall runs into the room. He trips on something on the floor. His name is SLOBBO. He isn’t as fat as his name sounds. \n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"Awwww yyyeah! \n"
"\n"
"That is Slobo’s catch phrase and he says it in a real funny way. \n"
"\n"
"SCIENTIST LADY:\n"
"Bruce, you saved my life. \n"
"\n"
"The Scientist Lady was only faking being dead. \n"
"\n"
"SCIENTIST LADY:\n"
"Are you married?\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Only to my job.\n"
"\n"
"SCIENTIST LADY: \n"
"I find that attractive but also respectable.  \n"
"\n"
"She kisses Bruce’s cheek. \n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO: \n"
"What about MY cheek? Awwww maaaan.\n"
"\n"
"That is Slobo’s other catch phrase, which he says in a different but equally funny way. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce waits a few seconds for the audience to stop laughing before speaking.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Wait. Those lips were man lips not woman lips. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce pulls off the Scientist Lady’s wig. She is actually Bruce’s boss, PAUL MARINE. Paul Marine is a douche.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"My boss. But why?\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"I wanted you to kill those guys because they wanted me dead. I knew you were real tough so you could kill them easy but I don’t respect you as an employee so I always make you do the shitty jobs even though you’ve been working at my company more than most of the other guys and are real smart. Also I don’t like you because my girlfriend finds you sexually attractive. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Now I understand. \n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Give me my time knife back. \n"
"\n"
"Paul Marine snaps his fingers and seventy-three goons surround Bruce.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"You can’t kill seventy-three goons so just give up.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I don’t have TIME for this.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce stabs himself with the time knife and disappears. \n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"He time traveled using the time knife. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce opens the door. Now he is twice as jacked.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"You’re even more sexually attractive. How is this possible?\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I stabbed myself and traveled to the past, then trained in all kinds of martial arts to become even stronger. I also strapped explosives into everybody’s boots in the past so that when I press this detonator you will all explode. \n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"Awwwww yyyyeah.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I’m glad I have stocks in this company.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Why?\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Because business… is booming.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce presses the detonator. All seventy-three goons blow up like eggs in a microwave. Paul Marine doesn’t explode.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Luckily I used my metal detector this morning and found the explosives. So I switched boots with somebody else. Say, Slobbo, whose boots are you wearing?\n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"NOOOOOO!!\n"
"\n"
"Slobbo explodes. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"My best friend. You’ll pay for this.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"You don’t want to stab me with that time knife.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Why not?\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Because I am actually you from the future. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"That doesn’t make sense.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Yes it does. Remember that the time knife is also a time machine. I am you from the future but I stabbed myself with the time knife in order to come back here and do all of this. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"But we don’t look the same.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"That is a good point and I am glad you brought it up. First I time travelled 700 years into the future to a time where humans have created advanced technology that allows surgeries that completely change people’s faces and bodies. I had this surgery performed so that you wouldn’t be able to recognize me, but I am actually you in disguise. I can prove it because I know many things about you. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Like what?\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"You have a birth mark on your left ankle.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I do have a birth mark on my left ankle. I am starting to believe you now. \n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"You should, because even though I have a new body I kept that birth mark on my ankle so that when I met you I could prove that I was actually you from the future. I will show you.\n"
"\n"
"Paul lifts up the left leg of his pants but there is no birth mark. Instead there is an ankle holster for a gun. Paul pulls out the gun and aims it at Bruce.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"I was lying this whole time. I’m not actually you. I was just saying all of that so that I could get my gun.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Son of a bitch.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Also in the future I melted the time knife and turned it into bullets. Those bullets are now in this gun, which means that I can shoot you but also send you through time all at once. Finally you will be out of my way so that I can marry my girlfriend Sofine later today before you are able to tell her that I’m a real shitty guy.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I didn’t know you were getting married today.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"I know. My girlfriend Sofine made an invitation for you because she admires you and thinks you’re attractive but I destroyed the invitation and then lied to her and said I gave it to you at work. But now I am here to give you a different invitation. To your funeral. \n"
"\n"
"Paul Marine shoots at Bruce.\n"
"\n"
"Slobbo jumps in front of Bruce.\n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"NOOOOOO!!\n"
"\n"
"Slobbo wasn’t actually dead. He jumps in front of the bullets and is shot several times. Now he’s actually dying. \n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"Avenge me.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Okay.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce goes to attack Paul Marine, but now Paul Marine has disappeared. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"He’s gone.\n"
"\n"
"Slobbo is dying on the ground covered in blood. His body is red like a hotdog covered in lots of ketchup. \n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"You must… stop the wedding. You are… totally a better guy and clearly more attractive than Paul. You should be… dating his girlfriend Sofine.\n"
"\n"
"Slobbo dies.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce just sits there next to Slobbo for a while because many people will be crying at this point. He eventually gets up.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Looks like I’m going to a wedding. After all…\n"
"\n"
"He holds out the time knife.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Somebody’s gotta cut the cake.\n"
"\n"
"“Cut the cake” means he’s going to kill Paul. The audience will understand because of the way the actor says it. It’s a real intense moment.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce puts on his shades.\n"

"He used to be a pretty promising football player, he actually got drafted by the Rexes, which I guess you can consider an achievement if you give a shit about that sort of thing, which I don’t. Not that he ever went anywhere, because he messed up his knee in a car crash on the night of getting the news, and that was it for his big career. There’s no police report on this, but looking at his social media at the time, seems like he was out celebrating pretty hard, so I’m pretty sure he had no business getting behind the wheel in the first place.\n"
"\n"
"In an apparent attempt to prove the universe runs on irony, he now drives a cab. License and permits check out; he’s got eight unpaid parking tickets, a couple more for speeding, pretty much what you’d expect.\n"
"\n"
"No relatives except his father, but the old man’s in the hospital and pretty much dead to the world from what I can tell. Looks like Marsters on a dozen different dating apps, with very limited success. Big surprise. And he seems to be seriously into weird conspiracy theories and bullshit like that, only without the usual crazy racist frothing at the mouth. It’s all pretty dumb, but surprisingly entertaining.\n"

"\n"
"She’s into this whole activist lifestyle, always protesting this or that, and generally just hugging every tree and saving every whale she sees. Yawn. On average, she signs two petitions a week and generally spends half her life sticking her nose in other people’s shit. Credit where it’s due, she’s pretty good at it. Also, she’s got a lot of friends who’re all into this stuff, and she seems to be real good at getting them coordinated. Kinda makes her perfect for our purposes, ‘cause if you can talk her into saying what we want, there’s a lot of folks who’re gonna listen.\n"
"\n"
"No boyfriend, or girlfriend, I dunno which way she swings (why doesn’t she put that on the internet, doesn’t she know that’s what it’s for?), but there’s that family of hers, looks like she’s got real close ties. So if we need leverage, that’s where you’ll find it.\n"

"You may wanna make sure she stays on our side, though. Like I said, she’s pretty popular with the rest of these people, and if they get the idea she’s been screwed over, they just might get pretty mad.

"They’re saying that William and Jack Joyce have both been detained. Did you manage to get to William first? Did he reveal the location of the countermeasure? You said you could get Jack out of there. What happened? \n"
"\n"
"Interesting developments over here. With the team focused on the university op, I managed to dig through an old email correspondence between Paul Serene and Dr. Kim. The content of the messages is very cryptic, but before he died, Kim was running some kind of tests from his lab, and William's research and a device related to this were somehow connected to what he was doing. Did he know about the countermeasure?\n"
"\n"
"I think I need to get into Kim’s lab and find out more, but that place has been on restricted access since he died. Not a lot of choice, though; if Jack and William are in custody, then that lab may be our only lead left. I’m just not sure how to do it. I sure as hell can’t just ask somebody to let me in there."

"I share your concern. Paul’s treatments are becoming increasingly ineffective and I hypothesize that the onset of the Fracture will increase the Chronon Syndrome’s rate of progression exponentially. I’ve been trying to take a more calculated approach at finding a permanent cure for Paul’s sickness, but Martin Hatch has shifted all the necessary resources into our tech division instead. I’m beginning to question his behavior. Every attempt I’ve made to discover a cure has been met with Martin’s red tape. Just between us, I do start to wonder if Martin even wants Paul to be cured. \n"
"\n"
"I’ve looked into Martin’s past. He began work for Monarch in 2001, but I couldn’t find any records about his past, or any aspect of his life before then. It’s almost as if he just appeared out of nowhere. He was the only one present during the accident that claimed Dr. Kim’s life. I don’t want to jump to conclusions… but I do wonder what his agenda truly is.\n"
"\n"
"Regarding your question, unfortunately there is nothing of value in Dr. Kim’s lab aside from Paul Serene’s treatments and confidential files that would be of no use to your research. We will have to find another way to develop a cure.\n"

"Given the very recent events at the dry docks, I now see exactly what you mean. Clearly, you were right about Burke’s loyalties being more fickle than they appeared. \n"
"\n"
"Of course, we have plenty of unanswered questions about how it came to this. To begin with, I don’t see why Burke would be involved with Joyce. There’s no way he did it out of some kind of an altruistic urge, there has to be more to it. We know Burke didn’t divert Joyce’s transport, since whereabouts at that time are accounted for. So there has to be somebody else involved, too.\n"

"DATE: OCT 8, 2016 – 9:47am\n"
"SUBJECT: RE: Liam Burke’s status\n"
"\n"
"Clarice,\n"
"\n"
"I understand why you consider Mr. Burke an asset to our future plans. Unfortunately, while he is an exceptional individual, he is less suitable for the kind of duties you have in mind than may be immediately obvious. I’ll explain.\n"
"\n"
"Yes, he’s been trained as a Striker. But Mr. Burke WAS disqualified, and for good reason.\n"
"\n"
"The men we have chosen to be Strikers have strict physical requirements, a certain moral flexibility, and the kind of killer instinct you have to be born with, cultivated to a fine degree. A ferocious knack for survival. Mr. Burke certainly has those qualities. He wasn't disqualified from the Striker program because he lacked them, or because he couldn’t wrap his head around the technical aspects of operating the technology; in fact, his performance was exceptional. So I fully agree with you that he’s an impressive operative.\n"
"\n"
"But Strikers, by their very nature, have to be made aware of Project Lifeboat and its purpose, at least on a general level, and that means they have to able to accept its implications. Unfortunately, Mr. Burke has a deep attachment to his wife, and the fact is that even if we brought Mr. Burke in, that wouldn’t guarantee a spot for her in the program. To be blunt: we don’t need any more nurses, and we’re already at capacity overall. We need Mr. Burke, but we don’t need his wife. Mr. Burke would never accept that, particularly now that Mrs. Burke is pregnant. Therefore, it’s vital that he doesn’t understand the nature and scope of the threat we face.\n"
"\n"
"As for having him play a role in other aspects of future developments, I suspect that despite his seemingly amoral nature, Mr. Burke may have other qualms he’s not consciously aware of. If he ever has to truly make a choice between conflicting loyalties, he may take a stand on principle and elect to act against his own best interests.\n"
"\n"
"That’s not a chance I’m willing to take.\n"

"SUBJECT: Liam Burke’s status\n"
"\n"
"Sir,\n"
"\n"
"I’ve been thinking about Liam Burke. I know you’ve worked closely with him for a while now, and he’s been useful, but there are assignments we can’t use him for because of his insufficient security clearance. For instance, having to keep him in the dark about much of what will happen at the university – about the stutters we’re expecting, about where it’ll lead – makes him a far less effective field operative than I’d prefer and causes quite a bit of logistical difficulty, given that he’s still going to be a part of the operation. And frankly, it feels like wasted potential.\n"
"\n"
"I’d like you to consider the possibility of bringing Burke into the fold. He's completed most of the Striker training, and even though he didn’t finish the program, he made an impression on me as a tremendously capable asset. His service record is exemplary, and he has a well-earned reputation as somebody who gets things done, no questions asked.\n"
"\n"
"By the same token, I would love to include Burke in our long-term plans. We could use a man like him in our corner, and I could deploy him far more effectively.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know what you think."

"\n"
"First of all, I have to again register my objection. What you are having me do under the guise of a “psych evaluation” is a blatant violation of Liam Burke’s doctor-patient confidentiality, and the only reason I’m doing this is because you leave me no other choice. Now, I recognize that in the world to come, our current rules and legislation – even our standards of morality – may no longer be applicable, but we aren’t there yet. You and Mr. Serene are placing the long-term mental wellbeing of hundreds of individuals in my hands, and I’m telling you right now, if they don’t trust not only me, but the system that put all of us in our particular positions, there’s no way we can recover from it.\n"
"\n"
"On to Burke. It is my considered professional opinion that the man is a bit of a powder keg. For all his calm exterior, he’s under tremendous pressure. I understand your reasoning for pulling him out of the Striker program, but what you have essentially done is instill in him a sense of encroaching doom. He doesn’t know the specifics, obviously; he didn’t make it far enough in the program to be briefed on that, but he knows that we’re preparing for a future threat that is somehow related to the flow of time being interrupted – and that there are dangers out there, dangers that we have specifically been training the Striker units for.\n"
"\n"
"There are men who are content to merely follow orders and let others worry about the consequences. Burke is not one of them. He is willing to commit acts of violence without asking why, but don’t mistake that lack of qualms for blind obedience. Burke needs agency; he has a fundamental need to feel in control of his life, and you have put him in a position where that’s no longer possible for him. He’s good at seeing patterns and drawing accurate conclusions from the facts available to him, and he has deduced – quite correctly – that he was being trained for a specific scenario that Monarch believes will happen. He is also painfully aware of the fact that if and when that scenario arrives, he will not be a part of the solution. He understands the nature of the Striker suits, that they are only useful in a zero state situation – and he understands that in such a situation a man without a Striker suit is, essentially, dead. He doesn’t know about the Lifeboat protocol, obviously – but if he did, he’d then also know he’s not a part of it.\n"
"\n"
"Either way, the bottom line is that he’s in a hopeless situation. He fears that the end of the world is coming, and he knows that if it does, the only way he could survive is with the technology Monarch has denied him access to. He doesn’t understand the details, or even the exact nature of that end of the world, but that just makes it worse. Fear and lack of understanding breed tremendous anxiety, Mr. Hatch; he may not show it, but believe me, Burke feels it – for himself and for his family. (It may interest you to know that his wife is pregnant. You can understand how that adds to the pressure.)\n"
"\n"
"To be honest, given the parameters we’re operating under, I don’t know how to resolve this. In Burke, you have a tremendously efficient operative, but you’ve put him in an impossible position. I believe he will remain effective as long as he doesn’t have reason to believe the scenario he fears is imminent, but once he believes it has arrived, all bets are off. That is, unless you can give him hope of survival – but at this point, resentment and suspicion are starting to turn into paranoia, and, frankly, I’m not sure he would trust either of us anymore.\n"
"\n"
"And speaking of trust, I recommend you think about what I said in my opening paragraph, Martin. Our greatest challenge – and greatest assets – in the subjective years to come won’t be technological, but all too human. Don’t make the mistake seeing people as just entries on a spreadsheet."

"-NOTE: Find appropriate accompanying cat photo. \n"
"-NOTE: No cat photo. \n"
"-No science explained here. Marketing bullshit. Time machine = works. Implications = limitless. \n"
"-Give me your money spiel. Build up existence of time machine. \n"
"-Content here dependent on findings from first human test later tonight.\n"
"-Findings, facts dumbed down for the mouth breathers who will inevitably want to invest. \n"
"-Purpose of guide – to explain to mouth breathers how the machine works and why.\n"
"-NOTE: proof-read and delete all “mouth breather” references. \n"
"\n"
"TIME MACHINE OVERVIEW\n"
"-How research started. Include gratuities for research grant. Sucking ass – community and investors. \n"
"-NOTE: Also thank Jack for his patience. Now that this is over I promise to be there for him.\n"
"-NOTE: Too personal.\n"
"-Basic overview of time machine. \n"
"-Parts.\n"
"\n"
"CHRONON PARTICLES\n"
"-NOTE: Nobody will give a shit about this or understand. Skip it.\n"
"\n"
"HOW TIME TRAVEL WORKS – SIMPLEST TERMS\n"
"-Subject activates time machine (step 1: core, step 2: the corridor)\n"
"-Subject sets the desired time travel date.\n"
"-Subject enters the corridor. \n"
"-Compare corridor to donut in shape to explain.\n"
"-NOTE: Add joke: “You don’t want to eat this donut or your body will suffer terminal chronon saturation leading to your slow but inevitable death”.\n"
"-NOTE: Cut joke. Disturbing.\n"
"-Subject walks around the corridor. \n"
"-Walking clockwise around corridor = travel to future.\n"
"-Walking counter-clockwise around corridor = travel to past.\n"
"-Clock-like design.\n"
"-Subject arrives at new time in future or past.\n"
"\n"
"SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM – TRAVEL ACROSS SPACE\n"
"-Time travel is not a portal. Spatial destination will not always be the same as entry point.\n"
"-Time travel is tied to a rotating black hole core. \n"
"-NOTE: Explain the core first?\n"
"-NOTE: Fuck it. Just compare the core to a car engine.\n"
"-NOTE: Look up info on car engines.\n"
"-Subject will arrive in future/past at the location where the time machine and core were located in that time. \n"
"-Cannot travel to a time when time machine and core are not active.\n"
"-Cannot travel to a time before core was first activated.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES OF HOW TIME TRAVEL WORKS\n"
"-In 1999 a time machine core is first activated. The time machine is located on an island. In 2000 the same time machine (with the same core) is moved to a circus tent. Teddy enters time machine in 1999 and travels to 2000. He exits the time machine and is in a circus tent. \n"
"-NOTE: Use better examples. No circus tent.\n"
"-Teddy cannot travel to a time before 1999 because the core was not active. \n"
"-Will bang my goddamn head against the wall every time somebody uses example of not being able to go back and kill Hitler to try to sound clever/funny.\n"
"-NOTE: A dinosaur joke, though?\n"
"-NOTE: Explain you can't go back and see dinosaurs. Fucking sucks.\n"
"\n"
"CLOSED LOOPS\n"
"-In theory all actions resulting from time travel = already accounted for.\n"
"-Should not be able to change the past. Any attempt to change things was always part of the chain of events in the 1st place. Already happened. Explain Novikov self-consistency principle until heads go pop.\n"
"\n"
"METAPHOR TO EXPLAIN CLOSED LOOPS\n"
"-Time is an egg. You can move the egg but no matter where you move it the same chicken will hatch.\n"
"-NOTE: Terrible example. Plus you could just eat the fucking egg. \n"
"-“An egg is sitting on the table. You leave the room, come back, and the egg is broken on the floor. You aren’t sure how this happened but it saddens you. The egg was important to you because (insert reason that makes sense here later). You travel to the past to prevent the egg from breaking. When you arrive in the past you rush over to the table, accidentally bump it, the egg falls and breaks. You caused the very thing you tried to prevent. Closed loops. Why the hell do all my examples end up being about eggs?\n"

"RIVERPORT PHYSICIST ON THE RISE\n"
"June 4th, 1997\n"
"\n"
"Dr. Joyce and Dr. Meyer became household names earlier this year when their paper on the proposed existence of a chronon field became one of the most hotly debated theories in the quantum physics community since the Higgs boson. William Joyce, born and raised in Riverport, wasn’t satisfied with simply being a part of the discussion and decided to actively search for proof. His proposed research project led to him obtaining the highly prestigious Harold Steinberg Fund, with an estimated value of $150,000. \n"
"\n"
"Dr. William Joyce is officially the youngest recipient of the Harold Steinberg research grant to date. While the specifics of his research proposal remains confidential, it is likely that Joyce aims to demonstrate clear proof of the so-called Meyer-Joyce Field, as well as potential applications for the manipulation of this field. A research timeline has been established with milestones that point to early 1999 as the period when this research will be ready for public unveiling. \n"

"How is this possible? How have they followed my designs so closely? Somebody’s been watching me all this time, haven’t they? Somebody is orchestrating this, all of it. I’m being followed. At first I thought it was paranoia but it’s true. A man has been watching my every move. I secretly took his photo, ran a search. His name is Liam Burke. He works for a security division of Monarch Solutions. I first noticed it weeks ago, but this could have been going on for YEARS. What does he want? What does he know? How is he connected to this? I need answers. I don’t know who I can trust anymore. I don’t know who else is involved, what they want, why. \n"

"RIVERPORT COASTAL DEFENSES\n"
"\n"
"The coastal defense installation of Riverport was commissioned on August 2, 1940, and completed in September, 1942, as America faced the realities of World War II. In addition to the fortifications and artillery, it also boasted an extensive tunnel system that linked Gull Island to the mainland, enabling free movement of personnel and materiel even under siege conditions. It was built in preparation for an attack on the United States that, fortunately, never came.\n"
"\n"
"The original plan also called for the construction of a large naval base in Riverport to support the US Navy in the Atlantic, taking advantage of the local ship-building industry, but as the United States entered World War II after Pearl Harbor, a change in resourcing priorities led to those plans being scrapped.\n"
"\n"
"This installation was in active use throughout the war, and the underground facilities continued to be used as a base for Navy intelligence work once World War II ended. The installation was decommissioned in 1961."

"Greetings Lifeboat personnel,\n"
"\n"
"The day has finally come to commence Phase 3 of our plan. Tonight, I will be hosting a gala to celebrate this monumental achievement, to which you are all invited. By now you have likely heard of the events that took place earlier today at Riverport University. Our path forward has not been impacted by this minor setback. We are ready for what comes next.\n"
"\n"
"Your part in this journey has not yet begun,  but the onset of the Fracture will bring with it new challenges that are worth reiterating. I am not able to go over many of these issues in detail at tonight’s gala because many guests will not have knowledge of the Lifeboat Protocol. As such, I am including a high level document outlining key points worth addressing: \n"
"\n"
"1. The Path Forward – Our Journey Ahead\n"
"2. Lifeboat Protocol – Status of the Survival Program\n"
"3. Shifters – Dangers Awaiting Us at the End of Time\n"
"4. R and D Tour – Our Future at Work\n"
"\n"
"1. THE PATH FORWARD\n"
"When you were first chosen for the Lifeboat Protocol, you were sent a package illustrating in great detail several events that would come to pass. It was stressed that these events were unavoidable. Many of you were reluctant to believe this, but every single one of those events has since occurred, including, to our great regret, the onset of the Fracture. This provides empirical evidence of my knowledge and understanding of the future, and I trust it has dispelled your doubts. No future event that I have experienced can ever be prevented. This includes the End of Time. It cannot be avoided.\n"
"\n"
"However, it can be survived. \n"
"\n"
"Survival in the End of Time has been the primary mission of Monarch Solutions since its inception. Your loyalty to this cause will prove invaluable as we move forward. I know this isn’t easy, but in the face of immutable facts, sacrifices must be made in the name of our survival. From this point forward, we will have to start making those sacrifices at a rapid pace. While we do know the exact date and time at which the complete End of Time will occur, our knowledge about the escalation in stutters and time anomalies leading to it is far less complete. We do, however know that it will be dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"For the first time in 17 years, we are entering a phase of the relative unknown. Adjustments will need to be made along the way, both in response to the effects of the Fracture’s progress, and to the less cosmic events that we will find ourselves in. We ask for your patience in this trying time.\n"
"\n"
"2. LIFEBOAT PROTOCOL\n"
"You are the chosen few who will survive the End of Time. When time stops, your journey will continue in the safety of the Lifeboat. The chronon particle harvesting operation is nearing completion. The Lifeboat has been confirmed to be able to run solely on that chronon power, as regulated by the Chronon Field Regulator. Current data indicates that the Lifeboat will remain sustainable for approximately 50 years – subjective years, of course, as no time at all will pass outside the Lifeboat.\n"
"\n"
"Given the preliminary research we have achieved using the CFR, we estimate that it will take at least two subjective decades for the Lifeboat team to discover a permanent solution for the End of Time. Given the nature of the problem, this is of course highly speculative, and the solution could prove to be more elusive than we’re hoping.  However, by the time the Lifeboat Protocol is activated we are confident that we will be able to increase our chronon particle reserves and their sustainability to a point where we have a runtime of upwards of 200 subjective years. Or, to put it another way, if there is a solution to the End of Time, I am 100% confident that the Lifeboat team will have the necessary time to discover it.\n"
"\n"
"3. SHIFTERS\n"
"We briefed you all on the danger of Chronon Disrupted Wave Function Subjects, or what are now being referred to as “shifters.” We estimate that they will begin to emerge within stutters only as the End of Time nears. The Lifeboat has been tested and we can say with absolute certainty that the stutterproof technology will protect the Lifeboat from shifters. Using a living sample in Dr. Kim’s lab we have proven that shifters cannot manifest without the presence of a stutter. We will make sure that you are transported to the safety of the Lifeboat before they arrive.\n"
"\n"
"Floor 3 of the Lifeboat has been built to house the Monarch Solutions Striker and Juggernaut squads – a paramilitary unit trained to combat Shifters at the End of Time. Their presence will likely not concern you. However, in the event that travel outside the safety of the Lifeboat proves to be necessary for any reason, the Striker teams have been trained to navigate the End of Time and successfully eliminate Shifters. \n"
"\n"
"4. R and D TOUR\n"
"Tonight we will be sending you VIP passes for the gala which will permit entry into our high-security R and D facility on Gull Island. Many of you are, of course, already intimately familiar with these areas, given your technological and scientific expertise, but those who aren’t will undoubtedly find it interesting. You are welcome to join a tour to view the various pieces of tech that Monarch has developed during Phase 2 to prepare for our journey forward. We welcome you to take this opportunity to see for yourself that every development necessary for the Lifeboat Protocol is completely on schedule.\n"
"\n"
"Your dedication to our cause will assure our survival. Dark times are coming, but you are the light at the end of the tunnel. You are humanity’s salvation and hope. Together we will survive.\n"

"FROM: SOFIA AMARAL\n"
"DATE: OCT 9, 2016 – 11:59am\n"
"SUBJECT: The time machine\n"
"\n"
"Hello,\n"
"\n"
"I have just been informed that the time machine core we obtained from the university has reached Monarch HQ safely, and is currently being installed into the new time machine corridor system we have constructed there.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, the core of the time machine is the time machine; the corridor around it is merely the user interface. This means, of course, that once the installation work is complete, we have effectively moved the time machine from the university into the Monarch HQ. That said, we don’t intend to use it.\n"
"\n"
"Let me repeat that: there are no current plans to use the machine. We are not sure how safe it would be to use, given that its initial activation has caused the Fracture. I personally believe that now that the core has been activated, further use would be safe, but make no mistake: this is a hypothesis, not a proven fact. We know that the machine taps into the universal Meyer-Joyce field, and somehow that connection has caused the Fracture in the field, apparently because of a misconfiguration. We are looking into the specifics, but until we know for sure, it would be irresponsible to use the machine.\n"
"\n"
"However, having it in place gives us a degree of control. It allows us, in an emergency, to travel backwards (although we obviously can go no further than to the time of its activation, last night) or forwards as might be required. Obviously, being fully secured at our building’s restricted area on the top floor also means that nobody else can use the machine.\n"
"\n"
"I have to reiterate that the only person who may authorize the use of the time machine is Paul Serene. I do not have that authority; Martin Hatch does not have that authority. The only person who does is Mr. Serene. He takes this issue very seriously, and I strongly suggest that you do the same.\n"

"It has been brought to my attention that there is some confusion as to the reason for the upcoming evening gala on Gull Island. I understand that some feel that such a celebration is frivolous, even misguided, in the aftermath of last night’s events at Riverport University and the now-present, steadily advancing Fracture in time.\n"
"\n"
"These concerns are understandable, but they are missing the bigger picture. Monarch Solutions is now entering a phase in which its true purpose will be fulfilled. We have finally arrived at the moment for which we have spent years preparing.\n"
"\n"
"The purpose of this event is twofold.\n"
"\n"
"First of all, for those selected to be a part of the Lifeboat project as scientists, technicians, support personnel, or in some other role, it will be important to see and hear Paul Serene. Continued confidence in the survival program is vital for the continued  survival of Monarch, and, ultimately, the human race itself. This is particularly important given recent events; we need to present a desirable and reassuring counterpoint to the sacrifices we’ve had to make. Naturally, not everybody at the party will be among the chosen few, so a certain degree of informational hygiene will be required. I trust you will ensure that those reporting to you are informed precisely to the degree necessary.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, for all of our autonomy and vast resources, Monarch is not functionally independent from the rest of society. In order for our plans to succeed, we will need the support and cooperation of the authorities and numerous business partners, even though they don’t know our true goals. A demonstration of power and confidence, as well as a clear message that Monarch has the will and the reach to fulfill our plans, will go a long way towards securing that support. This is particularly important given our recent hardline approach. We cannot weather the storm of public opinion without support from Riverport’s higher echelons – and if they consider us weak, or a liability, they may choose to probe deeper into our activities. This is precisely the kind of escalation we do not need at this crucial juncture.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, this is a tremendously important event for the future of Monarch Solutions, and for the future itself.\n"
"\n"
"If there are any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.\n"

Our PR blitz has been working well, but in order to maintain momentum, we must maintain an amicable relationship with Riverport’s leadership. Our entire approach is based on the idea of Monarch stepping in to assist the authorities, and being welcomed by citizens and city administration alike. Should the latter suddenly declare Monarch's help unwanted or unsanctioned, our entire strategy could collapse in just a few hours. That would be disastrous to our plans.\n"

"SUBJECT: Dream Journal 1\n"
"\n"
"Sofia, \n"
"\n"
"As promised in our latest session, I am now going to transcribe what I recall from my dreams. I still have doubts that this exercise will help alleviate my symptoms, but I’m willing to explore the idea further if you truly believe in its merit. (For someone who is not a medical doctor, let alone a mental health professional, you seem to take a great interest in my thoughts. Not that I don’t appreciate it.)\n"
"\n"
"Here is my first attempt:\n"
"\n"
"I recall a haunting image of seven red doors. Each door had a wrought iron handle that was dripping liquid metal onto the ground, creating a pool in the middle of the room. I looked down into the aqueous metallic glow at my feet to see my own glimmering reflection, revealing that I had aged half a lifetime. Startled, I looked back up to discover that only one door remained. Jack Joyce stood in front of it.\n"
"\n"
"The heat in the room was overwhelming. Jack was sweating profusely, his skin red and peeling open. He begged me to take him back home, but there was no door leading home. I opened the only door left and entered, discovering that we were back in the same room we had just exited. He refused to come to terms with this and opened the door again. I followed him, over and over as he desperately opened the doors, forever leading us back to where we started. The heat grew and he howled in pain, begging to know why I made the other doors disappear, why there was only one path. He begged me to bring the other doors back. He begged me to take him home.\n"
"\n"
"The iron pool burst into flames. Jack screamed in agony. I grabbed him, told him that we needed to learn to endure the heat, to embrace the flame. I knew it would come to pass eventually, but the only way to survive it was to accept its inevitability. My body began swaying rapidly, dancing to the movement of the flames around me until my bones faded out of existence and I surrendered to the fire until we were one and the same. \n"
"\n"
"I was no longer one being in one place and time. My life force spread evenly across the flames, until I was no longer an individual in one body, but a grander shifting entity. I could feel Jack being consumed within my essence. I felt a power within the heat, a clarity of intent. I forgot about my desire to ever return from the flames, because the body that once desired to return was lost forever. I became the very thing that I entered, and it became me, a cyclical fury chasing itself. Ouroboros. \n"
"\n"
"I woke up in a cold sweat. I quickly wrote down words that poisoned my mind in that moment. \n"
"\n"
"Delmore Schwartz was right. “Time is the fire.”"

"We’ve looked at the preliminary data on the frequency and severity of the stutters and crunched the numbers, and the results are alarming. Our original projection, which gave us years until the Fracture reached the point where time breaks down completely, does not match up with the progression of stutters we are experiencing. Put simply, the stutters are happening more and more frequently, clearly indicating that the Meyer-Joyce field is breaking down much faster than we thought. Taking the rate of acceleration, we can hypothesize that we might have as little as 24 hours until we reach the End of Time, or the point at which time stops, and no longer starts up again.\n"
"\n"
"We do not know why the original projection was wrong, and why that data – which we do consider reliable, coming as it does from Mr. Serene – seems to entirely contradict our current findings. Regardless, the main issue seems clear: in order to achieve Monarch Solutions’ stated goals, the Lifeboat protocol should be activated ASAP."

"SLIDE ONE: \n"
"\n"
"Much of what we know about the Shifters is theoretical, based on observations made by Mr. Serene and the limited experimentation we have been able to conduct on the only subject we have managed to capture.\n"
"\n"
"They do not seem to have a stable physical presence; rather, the data we are gathering appears to be fragmented and contradictory, as if there were countless versions of the subject occupying the same space. Our current theory is that they somehow exist in a persistent state of quantum superposition – or, to put it another way, with reference to the famous “Schrödinger’s cat” thought experiment, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time.\n"
"\n"
"The full mechanics and implications of this exceed our current understanding, but on a practical level, it seems to make them highly resistant to injury – it appears that even if the Shifter encounters deadly force, it may kill one of its aspects, but because it exists as multiple iterations of itself, including iterations that were not killed by the force, it doesn’t stop.\n"
"\n"
"Current theory suggests that the only way to stop a Shifter is to cause its wave function to collapse from the superposition to a single eigenstate. In practical terms, the Shifter must be affected with deadly force enough times for it to run out of healthy versions of itself. As such, direct confrontation with a Shifter should be a last resort.\n"
"\n"
"SLIDE TWO:\n"
"\n"
"Contact with a Shifter is extremely dangerous. We know that they are essentially mobile repositories of vast amounts of chronon particles, and that they can only exist in a zero state – an area which has been depleted of chronon particles, typically by a fault in the Meyer-Joyce field that encompasses the universe. Colloquially, we refer to these as “stutters” in time. We also know that Shifters are hostile to any source of chronon particles other than themselves within stutters, so any chronon active individual within a stutter may find themselves targeted by Shifters. It appears that movement in stutters – by which we mean the very movement of particles within the space in which time flows, not merely the movement of an individual – disturbs them, and they respond with considerable aggression.\n"
"\n"
"As discussed previously, Shifters are extremely resistant to damage. They are also quite physically formidable, but their biggest threat is the distortion field around them. Its exact nature is unknown, but we know it warps the properties of the space surrounding them, exerting great physical stress and unpredictable forces on its surroundings. Again, in practical terms: close proximity to a Shifter may be fatal even if no actual physical contact takes place.\n"
"\n"
"SLIDE THREE:\n"
"\n"
"The stutterproofing technology Monarch Solutions has advanced offers solid protection against Shifters; time flows normally within a stutterproofed area, so Shifters simply cannot exist within them. Therefore, as long as stutterproofing remains active, Shifters are not a problem. However, stutterproofing of large outside areas is not feasible, given our chronon particle budget, so we have developed other technology to defend against Shifters: the chronon dampeners.\n"
"\n"
"A chronon dampener works by annihilating free-floating chronon particles within a specificed area. As Shifters’ forms are hypersaturated with chronon particles, they cannot enter an area in which a chronon dampener is active without their wave function collapsing. Therefore, our operatives in the field have a solid portable defense against Shifters.\n"
"\n"
"Our own technology is shielded against the dampeners’ effects, so activities in stutters undertaken by our Strikers and other operatives are not hindered. However, as an unfortunate side effect, the dampeners have a crippling effect on individuals who are chronon active without the aid of technology. \n"

"Accordingly, should Mr. Serene be present, you should always make him aware of your intentions before activating a dampener. You may rest assured that the dampener is not powerful enough to do actual physical harm to Mr. Serene, whose system constantly produces new chronon particles to replace the ones that are lost, but as the dampener’s effects are unpleasant and enervating, such an encounter is likely to lead to an awkward conversation about future career prospects."

"CFR BRIEFING\n"
"By Dr. Sofia Amaral\n"
"\n"
"It’s no exaggeration to say that the Chronon Field Regulator, or the CFR, is at the heart of all of Monarch’s technological advances. It has taken on a somewhat mythical quality, given its origins and the vital role it plays in the Lifeboat project, but in actuality, the CFR’s applications are very practical.\n"
"\n"
"That’s not to say the CFR hasn’t had a course-altering impact on the work Monarch Solutions does. It’s been hugely influential in the development of both the stutterproofing technology that allows us to shield large areas from the effects of a zero state, enabling time to keep flowing within them even as it stops everywhere else, as well as the smaller, personalized application of the same technology: the portable chronon harnesses that allow our soldiers and technicians to operate freely within stutters.\n"
"\n"
"We think of Dr. Henry Kim as the father of all this technology, and deservedly so, but for all of his brilliance, it was his dedication to uncovering the secrets of the CFR that allowed him to make his breakthroughs. Despite Dr. Kim’s hard work, the CFR’s functionality is still not fully understood, and we have not been able to replicate the device. Having more than one of them would obviously be greatly advantageous to us, but we find ourselves in a precarious position where in order to fully investigate it, we would have to take it apart. Given its immense power, such an undertaking would pose obvious risks. Perhaps even more importantly, there’s no guarantee that we would be able to put it back together again. Given that it’s vital to the implementation of the Lifeboat protocol, it’s our policy to leave it intact.\n"
"\n"
"We do know, however, that the CFR can not only store an immense amount of chronon particles, it can also tap into the Meyer-Joyce field and, with great precision, manipulate it. It’s this unique ability that our own chronon technology replicates, albeit at far less control and efficiency. It’s also what makes the Lifeboat protocol a reality. By itself, our stutterproofing technology is powerful and reliable, but its rate of chronon particle consumption is high, and it increases at an alarming rate as we widen the volume of space the stutterproofing covers. This would, on the face of it, make the stutterproofing a very temporary solution indeed – one that could perhaps buy us some subjective weeks once we enter a permanent zero state, but which would ultimately only delay the inevitable.\n"
"\n"
"However, the CFR changes all of that. When the permanent stutterproofing installed on the Lifeboat – indeed, the very stutterproofing that makes the Lifeboat the Lifeboat in the first place – is directed by the CFR, the system becomes vastly more efficient. Our chronon particle consumption is reduced to around 1% of what it otherwise would be. Given that chronon particles are hard to source, even at our Ground Zero installation, and our stockpiles are decidedly limited, this means that the CFR makes the difference between Lifeboat being a temporary stopgap solution, or a very long-term undertaking that, hopefully, allows us to eventually find a solution to the End of Time."

"It seems we are having an even busier day than we anticipated. Be aware that both Liam Burke and Jack Joyce are now being held in the detention center at the island. It should go without saying that Burke no longer has any authority within Monarch Solutions, and should be treated as any other detainee. Both Burke and Joyce are considered exceptionally dangerous, and Joyce particularly so; he is chronon active, and should be handled with caution. That said, Joyce has given himself up. It’s possible that he has realized the futility of his position and the fight has simply gone out of him, but I’m not convinced he has no ulterior motive.\n"
"\n"
"Mr. Serene has to concentrate on his speech tonight. It’s extremely important to the future of this company, so please ensure that everything goes smoothly.\n"
"\n"
"In the meantime, I will personally be conducting an interrogation of Joyce. Please expect my arrival at the detention center shortly.\n"

"\n"
"It appears we have been overtaken by events, and we have had to adjust our plans accordingly. As you are no doubt aware, we now have Jack Joyce in custody; he gave himself up earlier today. As Mr. Serene has a personal interest in Joyce and the information he might have, he will be interrogating him at the detention center on the island.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this means that Mr. Serene cannot be there for the speech he was scheduled to give at the gala event tonight, so I will have to stand in for him. I have some new security requirements pertaining to that, but I will discuss those with specific individuals in person.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, be aware that in addition to Joyce, we also have Liam Burke held at the detention center. Despite his long service to Monarch, Burke is now to be considered hostile, and has already done quite a bit of damage to us. I shouldn’t have to say this, but just to be absolutely clear: any orders given by him should be ignored.\n"
"\n"
"Please ensure that Joyce is ready for Mr. Serene. Also please bear in mind that Joyce is chronon active, and extremely dangerous. He has given himself up voluntarily, so it’s entirely possible he doesn’t intend to cause trouble, but let’s make sure we’re prepared if he does. We don’t know his motivations, and I would not put it past him to use his surrender as a means to exact a hidden agenda.\n"

"Paul Serene has become preoccupied with the appearance of Jack Joyce. He has put aside his engagements at tonight’s gala in order to focus on some feeble attempt to convert Jack to our cause. This distraction presents us with the perfect opportunity to push our agenda. Tonight we send Monarch into a state of chaos. Tonight we ensure Paul Serene’s downfall. \n"
"\n"
"I have managed to convince Paul to allow me to deliver the gala speech on his behalf, creating the perfect cover. \n"
"\n"
"Steps are as follows:\n"
"\n"
"1. GALA SHOOTING\n"
"I will be delivering Paul’s speech at the gala very soon. I have arranged for an inside resource to fire shots in my direction from a vantage point halfway through the speech, narrowly missing me on stage. This will throw the gala into pandemonium and destabilize Monarch to a point where Paul’s authority and control of the situation will be called into question. More immediately, it will force Monarch to initiate security measures that will lead to Sofia Amaral being locked into the nearby Monarch villa \"for her protection.\"\n"
"\n"
"2. DRONE SABOTAGE\n"
"Stetson will recalibrate Drone A7’s flight pattern and cause it to crash directly into the villa, killing Sofia Amaral and therefore removing Paul Serene’s only means of developing the treatments necessary for his sickness.\n"
"\n"
"3. TREATMENT LAB DEMOLITION\n"
"In the aftermath of Amaral’s death I will head an investigation that will allow me to gain access to Dr. Kim’s lab, where the entirety of Paul’s treatments are kept. Demolition charges will be planted and every single treatment will be destroyed. With no further treatments forthcoming, Paul will be rendered helpless.\n"
"\n"
"With the stutters happening more and more often, I predict that Paul’s sickness will take hold within six hours of these events. Only then will we make our final move."

"\n"
"When Paul hears about Jack’s escape he will order Sofia Amaral to be locked away in the villa for protection. As Jack nears her location have Stetson sabotage the drone surveillance so that his movements will remain undetected. Assist Joyce’s mission in any covert manner possible.\n"
"\n"
"Sofia is Paul’s only resource capable of developing the treatments he needs. With her out of the picture, we only need to destroy his remaining treatments to render Paul helpless as his sickness grows. All of his treatments are kept in Dr. Kim’s lab. I will gain access to the area and ensure that the entire lab is destroyed. \n"

"Hello,\n"
"\n"
"I have just been informed that the time machine core we obtained from the university has reached Monarch HQ safely, and is currently being installed into the new time machine corridor system we have constructed there.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, the core of the time machine is the time machine; the corridor around it is merely the user interface. This means, of course, that once the installation work is complete, we have effectively moved the time machine from the university into the Monarch HQ. That said, we don’t intend to use it.\n"
"\n"
"Let me repeat that: there are no current plans to use the machine. We are not sure how safe it would be to use, given that its initial activation has caused the Fracture. I personally believe that now that the core has been activated, further use would be safe, but make no mistake: this is a hypothesis, not a proven fact. We know that the machine taps into the universal Meyer-Joyce field, and somehow that connection has caused the Fracture in the field, apparently because of a misconfiguration. We are looking into the specifics, but until we know for sure, it would be irresponsible to use the machine.\n"
"\n"
"However, having it in place gives us a degree of control. It allows us, in an emergency, to travel backwards (although we obviously can go no further than to the time of its activation, last night) or forwards as might be required. Obviously, being fully secured at our building’s restricted area on the top floor also means that nobody else can use the machine.\n"
"\n"
"I have to reiterate that the only person who may authorize the use of the time machine is Paul Serene. I do not have that authority; Martin Hatch does not have that authority. The only person who does is Mr. Serene. He takes this issue very seriously, and I strongly suggest that you do the same.\n"

"I’m going to attempt to access Dr. Kim’s lab tonight during the gala to find out if he knew about the countermeasure. I still think that’s our strongest lead. However, if I get inside, I should be able to shut down some of the security measures from inside. \n"
"\n"
"The problem is that getting inside that lab might prove to be a long shot. Couldn’t get a hold of Amaral’s key card so I’ve resorted to shameless flirting in order to find a means in. I’m going to the gala as Charlie Wincott’s “date” in hopes that he can get me inside.\n"
"\n"
"That’s if I can hold back from punching out the douche for that long. Consider this a test of restraint.\n"
"\n"
"I know that you think Jack is the key to obtaining the countermeasure, but the evidence is really stacking up that Dr. Kim knew something about the device. All of the research he did in that lab is classified. They’re hiding something big in there. I’ll let you know what I find.\n"
"\n"
"I’d warn you that your plan on the island sounds reckless, but I’m sure you’re fully aware. Keep in mind that the minute Dr. Amaral goes missing, the entirety of Monarch is going to be hunting you down. She’s the only thing keeping Serene alive. He won’t let her go without a fight.\n"

"Bruce has just had his best friend killed by his boss, Paul Marine. Bruce now has a time knife that sends things through time if he stabs them. He is going to Paul Marine’s wedding now to tell his girlfriend Sofine not to marry him because he’s a real shitty guy.\n"
"\n"
"INT. WEDDING BUILDING – DAY\n"
"\n"
"It is a wedding. Paul Marine and his girlfriend SOFINE are getting married. Sofine is real attractive. If most girls are ham sandwiches then she is a 16 oz steak. \n"

"But that’s impossible. Time travel doesn’t exist yet.\n"

"BRUCE:\n"
"That’s what they want us to think, but I actually have a knife that is also a time machine and sends people through time when I stab them.\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"I want to believe you but that doesn’t make sense. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"I will prove it. \n"

"Bruce grabs Sofine’s mom.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Here is a bunch of money for lottery tickets. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce gives Sofine’s mom a bunch of money for lottery tickets. He stabs her with the time knife, but gently not violently just so that she will travel through time. She disappears. \n"
"\n"
"Sofine’s mom enters the wedding building. She is now wearing different clothes.\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE’S MOM:\n"
"He is right. He stabbed me gently with the time knife and I was sent to the past. He also gave me a bunch of money which I used to buy a lottery ticket that I knew would win and now I have a million dollars.\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"You helped my mom become rich. Thank you Bruce.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"You made me rich the first moment I saw you. Rich in my heart. With love. \n"

"WEDDING MINISTER:\n"
"Or is he?\n"
"\n"
"The minister pulls off his mask. He is actually George Washington. \n"
"\n"
"GEORGE WASHINGTON:\n"
"Bruce knew you were getting married so he stabbed himself and traveled to the past, then stabbed me so that I would be sent to this time. I then pretended to be a wedding minister for the ceremony, but I am actually not a minister at all which means the marriage isn’t official. \n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"You did all of this for me?\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Yes. I stabbed George Washington because I love you. Also, the man you were about to marry wasn’t actually Paul Marine.\n"
"\n"
"Paul Marine takes off his mask. It’s Slobbo, Bruce’s best friend.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"This is actually a fake wedding. I saved Slobbo’s life and then had him disguise himself as your boyfriend to make this look real but it was actually a test to see if we were meant to be.\n"

"BRUCE:\n"
"But how?\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"I followed you to the past using my time bullets and discovered your plan to marry Sofine so I already married Sofine in the past. She didn’t want to, but then I showed her this baby.\n"
"\n"
"Paul Marine reveals a baby. \n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"I told her that this baby was actually our baby from the future and that I used time bullets to travel with the baby back to the past to show her that we had a family together in the future. But in reality it is just a baby that I stole that isn’t mine.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Then whose baby is it?\n"
"\n"
"The real Sofine enters wearing futuristic pants and a shirt.\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"Ours! \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"Are you Sofine from the future?\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"Yes. You are very quick to understand things. I came to the past to tell you that in the future you and I got married, Bruce. We had a very active and highly satisfying sex life which led to the birth of our future child, Urugae. That is the baby that Paul Marine is holding. He stole our baby.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"But why?\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE\n"
"Paul Marine stole our baby and then traveled to the past so that he could use the baby as a lie to trick younger me to marry him instead by saying that it was actually the baby that he would have with me in the future. The past version of me believed him and because of that I married Paul Marine instead and no longer ever marry you at all.\n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"Awwww mannnn.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"It’s over, Bruce. We’re married.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"Until death do you part. \n"
"\n"
"Bruce pulls out the time knife. Paul Marine pulls out his gun with the time bullets inside. \n"
"\n"
"They have the best fight of any movie ever. At the end Bruce has Paul Marine with a knife to his neck.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"

"Bruce lifts his knife up to cut Paul Marine.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"You won’t get me this easy!\n"
"\n"
"Paul Marine aims the gun at himself and shoots himself thirty times. The clip is bigger than a regular pistol. \n"
"\n"
"Paul disappears, but then thirty Paul Marines enter.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE: \n"
"I shot myself thirty times so that I was sent to many different times at the same time which meant there were thirty of me. Now we are all here to kill you. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Which means that each of you has a time bullet inside of you.\n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"Of course but I made sure that we were all shot in areas that have no vital organs and we will get the bullets removed after we kill you.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Unfortunately for you I traveled to the past earlier and took your gun and added an electric charge on each of your time bullets. I control the electric charges with this handheld detonator. \n"
"\n"
"PAUL MARINE:\n"
"No!\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE: \n"
"Yes. It’s quite… shocking.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce presses his detonator. All thirty Paul Marines are electrified from the inside. Their skin peels open all over like sausages that are left on the bbq for too long that peel open all over. The Paul Marines all die.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Consider this my resignation.\n"

"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"Congratulations. You passed the test.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"What test?\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"We always believed you were the chosen one so we traveled to the past to test you and make sure. We now believe you are ready to fight the ultimate villain from the future. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Okay.\n"
"\n"
"SLOBBO:\n"
"Who is the ultimate villain?\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
" His name is Paul Marine.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"But I just killed Paul Marine.\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"No. The Paul Marine you have known this whole time has actually been an actor from the future that we paid to play Paul Marine for the test. The actual Paul Marine is exactly the same but he lives in the future.\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"He was an actor. Which means my job was fake as well.\n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"Yes. That is the only reason why you were kept in a low-level position for so many years without a single promotion and it appeared that people didn’t give you the respect that you clearly deserve. Because in reality you are the chosen one. \n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"It all makes sense now. \n"
"\n"
"SOFINE:\n"
"We must travel to the future. Are you ready?\n"
"\n"
"BRUCE:\n"
"Looks like it’s TIME to find out.\n"
"\n"
"Bruce puts on his shades. George Washington waves the American flag. \n"

"Thank you for the update. We do not require the time machine to be activated in the near future, but from this point forward I want technicians on stand-by. Our plan requires absolute control. That is what the machine represents. More than anything, we want to protect the machine from falling into the hands of our enemies. We have to deny them the opportunity to disrupt our plans.\n"

"SUBJECT: MONARCH IS TAKING OVER\n"
"\n"
"BLANCH_MCDOUGAL 10-10-2016  01:12am\n"
"\n"
"I am not actually Blanch McDougal, but I have all kinds of inside scoops about Monarch and need to keep undercover until I find a way to save the world. I saw wut really went down at the university and got out just in the NICK of time to tell everybody all the crazy shit going on. Here is the truth.\n"
"\n"
"We r all fucked. Monarch built a playground of death and right now Riverport is going down the shit slide. Wut’s at the bottom? Something called the “end of time”. It’s all part of their master plan, which I am calling “Operation Clockstop”. Monarch took everybody from the university and tried to kill them so they wouldn’t talk about it. They just had a secret gala meeting about Operation Clock Stop at Gull Island.  \n"
"\n"
"Wut is the point of Operation Clockstop? As far as I can put together it all has to do with numbers. In 1999 Monarch was formed. In 2010 they bought out the industrial area, which they are now using to extract some weird energy shit. 1999 and 2010. 2010 – 1999 = 11. Multiply 11 by 2010 = 22,110. Backwards that’s 01122, which is close to the industrial area’s zip code. Some people r like “hey, Nick, that’s just a coincidence” but it can’t be cuz it goes way deeper.\n"
"\n"
"Monarch assaulted the university on October 9th, 2016. In numbers that’s 10 09 2016. Zeros r shaped like circles, kinda like dots in morse code, which would mean that all other the numbers r dashes in morse code. \n"
"\n"
"So 10 09 2016 in morse code = O – O – – O – – \n"
"\n"
"I looked that up in morse code. It could be a couple different sets of eltters:\n"
"\n"
"A A N M\n"

"R T T E M \n"
"\n"
"Unjubble all those letters and u can spell ARMAMENT and MEATMAN. Armament = weapon. Meatman = butcher. \n"

"Wut do butcher’s do? Chop and cut things. Wut do weapons do? Destroy things. Cutting things and destroying things r kind of connected. So there’s that. think about it.\n"

"By the way this theory is copyrite Blanch McDougal (secretly not Blanch McDougal) 2016. \n"

"ENTRY 63\n"
"I just got back from the funeral. My parents are dead. It feels like I was just told about the crash an hour ago. It isn’t real yet. Standing there I was numb to it all. Weighed down under some expectation to emote in a manner that suited the situation. As if I needed to cry to appease the crowd. \n"
"Jack was always the younger brother copying me. In that graveyard our roles were strangely reversed. Tears were running down my brother’s face and I was observing him like some alien desperately trying to learn to feel. Looking at the pain in his eyes, I wasn’t thinking about my parents at all. Only Jack. Death is supposed to bring the living closer together but I’ve never felt more distant from somebody I cared for so dearly. \n"
"It tears me up inside that I can’t protect him from what he’s going through. I can’t ease his pain. I don’t have the social proficiency to wield my empathy into some well-articulated apology that will make him forget this. The irony is that the only cure for his pain is time.\n"
"Time. Ever since February 28th, 1999, the concept has been given new meaning. The experiment was meant to give hope, not take it away. What I was told that day has haunted me ever since. The very notion of a Fracture in time has overshadowed everything since. Even this. \n"
"I don’t need to see the future to know that I will let him down. I can’t be the parental figure that Jack has lost. I can’t be the brother that he needs. It's Christmas – I can't even give him that. No one can. There’s nothing I want more than to protect him. And there’s only one way I know how to do that with certainty. \n"
"I will finish the countermeasure. I will make sure that the dangers I was warned of that day never come to pass. \n"
"I can’t fix the past. But it’s not too late for the future."

"I recall moving through a wheat field that once belonged to my grandparents. I pressed the wheat stalks to the side with my hands, softly sifting through them at first, but as I pressed forward the stalks began to warp and curl around my arms, providing resistance to my every move. The entire field began to solidify into an unbreakable material with my body entangled in the mess. I desperately tried to pull myself free, but every movement led to a burning sensation. \n"
"\n"
"The world desaturated. Time stopped. I heard the unmistakable sound of my greatest fear approaching. Shifters. They emerged from all sides, surrounding me. I looked into the distance and saw a blurry figure approaching. He tried to yell but the words wouldn’t escape his throat, instead transforming into an endless shriek pulsing through my ears. His every movement and sound transformed into an agonizing discomfort all throughout my body until it became completely unbearable. The pain trumped logic. I needed to make it stop. I needed to make it all stop.\n"
"\n"
"I grew violent, blindly lashing out at the figure, tearing him apart. I needed to destroy the source of motion and sound that caused me such discomfort. The pain stopped as I took the figure’s life, and as he died his identity became clear.\n"
"\n"
"It was me. \n"
"\n"
"I had become the very threat that I once feared. But I did not fear anymore. I felt something very clear, very pure. I turned around to discover Jack behind me. He didn’t move but I could somehow understand his intent. He welcomed me. Every misunderstanding, all the pain we had caused one another was forgotten. We were part of a higher consciousness. \n"
"\n"
"I heard a voice behind me. Dr. Kim. He joined us. He told me that time was once the fire in which we burned. He told me we would burn no more."

"\n"
"I know the situation is fluid and things are progressing fast, but I want to reiterate our strategy for maintaining control over the city of Riverport.\n"
"\n"
"As you all know, we can’t actually directly control the city. We don’t have the manpower, and we don’t have the actual authority. It’s therefore vital that we maintain a good relationship with the media and the local authorities, and have them do much of the heavy lifting for us. Ideally, everything we do should be either undertaken by the authorities under our discreet direction, or in cases where we take action ourselves, backed by the powers that be, creating the illusion that Monarch Solutions is working in cooperation with legal authorities.\n"
"\n"
"Make no mistake: although we’ve been successful thus far, the situation is not stable, and it can change quickly. If key parties in the city lose confidence in us and our ability to handle the crisis, our control will erode very quickly. Therefore, we must nurture this relationship even as we conduct our own operations, some of which involve considerable troop mobilization and combat action. This is a constant balancing act, and while I’m confident we can pull it off, there’s no room for error. We can’t afford to grow complacent and sloppy.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we are well-prepared for this contingency. Long before we reached this point, we established a good rapport with the Mayor, Riverport PD and other major authorities within Riverport, as well as most of the important media outlets. Our strategy is twofold:\n"
"\n"
"1. MAINTAIN CONTROL.  It’s imperative that we ensure that the city’s various power structures remain under our control. This means maintaining a close relationship with numerous individuals and organizations, as well as manipulating the information at their disposal. While Charlie Wincott is unfortunately no longer working on this project due to unforeseen complications, he has set up powerful tools and procedures for scrubbing the internet and identifying and locating problematic situations and individuals. We’re stationing people in key locations and maintaining control, often under the guise of “advisors” and “consultants” to people in power. They are ready to step in as required. Anybody working in these roles needs to be proactive and project a constant aura of helpful authority and dependability. Diplomacy is the order of the day, people; that’s vital for maintaining certain fictions, such as Jack Joyce’s culpability in the events at the university, etc.\n"
"\n"
"2. MINIMIZE CONFLICT. That is to say, make sure that individuals – whether they’re politicians, city officials, police officers, reporters, ordinary citizens, etc. – suffer a minimal impact from our activities. If we have to use force, the situation needs to take place out of sight and remain entirely contained. Whether containment means misdirection, coercion, intimidation, bribery or some other means depends on the circumstances, but it’s vital that nobody is left in a position to complain. To be explicitly clear: this doesn’t mean we can eliminate witnesses and cover it up. When people don’t come home, others start to ask questions, so that has to be a last resort. I expect all supervisors to monitor their teams closely to ensure things stay on an even keel. I know most of our operatives haven’t been trained in the soft touch, and I’ll be blunt: the last thing we need is somebody thinking this is Afghanistan and smacking a civilian around. We’re one YouTube video away from this whole thing blowing up in our faces, so we have to maintain our operational profile throughout.\n"
"\n"
"For all of these activities, we have a considerable budget. Monarch Solutions is very well off, we’ve been building resources for a long time, and this is considered a priority. So we can buy a lot of silence and cooperation from authorities and citizens alike. But that only works as long as those things are for sale – and the moment we’re seen as a threat, that opportunity will disappear.\n"
"\n"
"If you see a problem, be proactive, and CALL IT IN. Don’t let anything run out of control or think it’ll work itself out. We have to be sure. The situation can unravel faster than we think, and we have to coordinate our activities properly. Any questions or concerns, please contact me sooner rather than later."

"MONARCH SOLUTIONS\n"
"Mission Statement\n"
"By Paul Serene\n"
"December 12, 1999\n"
"\n"
"[LIMITED DISTRIBUTION! For approved employees only.]\n"
"\n"
"I have seen the path ahead, and I know it will be hard. I have founded Monarch Solutions to bring together those who will walk it with me – the elite few whose skill, dedication and passion will live on when everything else ends.\n"
"\n"
"To that end, \n"
"\n"
"1. We will work under my guiding vision of the future – my knowledge of what is coming. We accept that we cannot change our fate, nor can we avoid it. It is a harsh truth – but it is the truth. We will accept it and its full implications, but we will not deviate from our course, nor give in to despair, nor give up the fight.  Those of us who share in this knowledge, who learn the triumphs and tragedies of the days and years to come, will look past them, and find ways to turn them to our advantage. The gray, uncertain area beyond what is known will be where we build our empire, and we build it on the hope that we can persevere – that the end isn’t our end, that we can still succeed.\n"
"\n"
"2. We will expand Monarch’s influence and power in all possible spheres – financial, political, cultural, medical, technological, military – to the best of our ability. This is a goal unto itself. We will need to be in a position of exceptional resources and ability to act when the time comes. We will build. We will seek success and profit, not for the sake of wealth and fame, but for the sake of preparedness.\n"
"\n"
"3. We will develop science and technology to counter a very specific set of circumstances. This will require extensive research and experimentation, as well as a tremendous financial cost. We will not be daunted by these challenges. We will complete our work.\n"
"\n"
"4. We will not compromise. We recognize that sacrifice is required, and we are willing to pay the cost to meet our goals. There is no alternative to this. Doubt, qualms and sentiment are luxuries we cannot afford. Whatever we have to do is a lesser evil than the extinction of the entire human race, and to pretend otherwise is weakness. Nothing in the history of our planet has been as important as this. Nothing we have accomplished as a species matters if we fail in our mission.\n"
"\n"
"5. We will not fail.\n"
"\n"
"There will be many challenges in the years ahead. I know what’s coming. It can’t be averted. There’s no escaping it. But we can survive it, and we can overcome it. And we will. I am dedicating myself, this company, and every shred of willpower at my disposal to that mission.\n"
"\n"
"I expect the same from those who join me on it.\n"
"\n"

"ON THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE LIFEBOAT\n"
"By Dr. Sofia Amaral\n"
"August 18, 2016\n"
"\n"
"While the Lifeboat Protocol is fairly straightforward on the surface, it’s important that the people involved with the project understand how it radically differs from other survival scenarios against so-called apocalyptic threats.\n"
"\n"
"Stutterproofing\n"
"\n"
"A traditional bunker built to protect the occupants from an environmental hazard (e.g., a chemical attack or nuclear fallout) is typically sealed airtight, and the occupants have their own electricity, air supply, provisions, etc. The bunker’s interior is isolated from the outside environment. But the Lifeboat’s design is different. It’s not actually sealed, because it doesn’t have to be; it does have strong walls and protected access points, but the outside environment is not the problem – it’s the lack of the Meyer-Joyce field that enables time to exist that makes the outside hazardous. From a technological standpoint, these differences make the Lifeboat’s operating principles quite different, particularly with regards to maintenance.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to, say, the failure of the life support system in a hermetically sealed survival space, such as a bunker, the failure of the Lifeboat’s stutterproofing system has far more immediate and grave effects. A traditional life support system can be repaired – for instance, a failure in the CO2 scrubbers would pose a significant threat, but with replacement parts and tools, properly trained occupants could easily repair the system before they would feel any ill effects. In fact, almost any mechanical failure short of a full-scale environmental breach can be fixed as long as suitable repair materials and trained personnel are at hand.\n"
"\n"
"But by its very nature, the stutterproofing is different: if it fails, everybody within its area of effect is immediately affected by the zero state, and becomes frozen. In a permanent zero state scenario, that means they would have no opportunity to ever effect repairs; there’s literally no time to react. The only exception would be personnel wearing an activated chronon harness, such as the Striker suit, but given that repairing the stutterproofing system is a highly technical, complicated process requiring an exceptional proficiency in the operation and engineering of chronon technology, this would be a scenario with a low probability of success.\n"
"\n"
"It is therefore of utmost importance that the Lifeboat’s stutterproofing operates reliably and without faults, with multiple failsafe systems, because if it ever fails, it’s unlikely that it can be repaired or restarted. Accordingly, once the Lifeboat Protocol has been activated, there’s no real way to deactivate it other than removing the Chronon Field Regulator. This would be highly inadvisable, as doing so could not only disrupt the stutterproofing, but more importantly, without the CFR, the Lifeboat’s rate of chronon particle consumption is increased by a vast margin, effectively reducing its potential operating time to a fraction of what is intended.\n"
"\n"
"Unique advantages and risks\n"
"\n"
"However, it’s worth pointing out that even though the Lifeboat operation has unique hazards, there are also unique advantages. One such advantage is provisions. A traditional survival scenario in a bunker typically involves a poor quality of meals, due to obvious resourcing problems – anything that spoils easily is out of the question.\n"
"\n"
"In a zero state scenario, however, spoilage becomes a non-issue. Anything stored outside the stutterproofed area remains in perfect condition. This advantage doesn’t only apply to comestibles, but also makes the storage of medicine, volatile chemicals and other similar articles far less of a problem than it otherwise would be. In fact, given the fact that the city of Riverport is vast compared to the relatively small number of people residing in the Lifeboat, in theory Monarch operatives could venture outside the Lifeboat in chronon harnesses and actually enjoy freshly cooked meals simply by entering a restaurant and finding the ready-made dishes that have been prepared, remove them from the zero state to a stutterproofed area, and enjoy them, as hot and delicious as if they had been just prepared – which, in fact, they of course would be.\n"
"\n"
"To be clear: this is not a recommended activity, as it would be a foolish waste of resources to go after individual meals like that. The above scenario is mentioned here merely to illustrate the point; even though the Lifeboat has been designed to operate for decades of subjective time, it doesn’t actually need provisions for that long. If the Lifeboat’s own reserves start to run low, a well-planned supply run into the city could easily result in a great deal of perfectly preserved supplies.\n"
"\n"
"Another advantage is that while the situation outside the Lifeboat would be dire, people frozen in the zero state would not actually be dead. If a solution is found to the End of Time scenario, everybody would resume their everyday lives, most likely with no awareness of time ever having stopped. However, it’s hard to know what the exact psychological impact of that knowledge on Lifeboat personnel will be.\n"
"\n"
"There’s a real concern that the pressure of knowing that they have sole responsibility for the survival of the human race, and that there are billions of people outside of the walls of the Lifeboat, helpless and unaware, frozen eternally in that last moment, may prove to be crushing for some. On the other hand, knowing that their loved ones are actually not dead, and may be saved, and are not in any distress, or indeed even aware of the situation may prove to be a powerful motivating factor that helps us eventually resolve the situation. Of course, the solution to the problem of a permanent zero state is not currently within our reach, and we expect that finding one will take subjective decades, if it is indeed possible. We can but try.\n"
"\n"
"It’s worth noting that since the people outside Lifeboat are indeed not dead, merely stopped, it should be possible for a team of personnel wearing chronon harnesses to exit the Lifeboat, retrieve a person, and bring them into the Lifeboat. However, I advise against adopting this practice; for the occupants, that should forever remain a theoretical scenario. Any situation in which somebody is brought in from the outside would cause undue stress on the occupants, who would at that point have to become acutely aware that their loved ones could be brought in… but since the Lifeboat has limited space, this could never be allowed. That kind of psychological pressure would likely lead to friction and questions of favoritism and, ultimately, increase the risk mission failure."

"Beth,\n"
"\n"
"I know that this encounter will be a lot to take in. After all, it’s not every day you meet your future self. I’d tell you that you need to keep this all a secret, but I know you won’t listen. You’ll learn that lesson the hard way. \n"
"\n"
"The next few years won’t be easy for you. Nobody you know is ever going to understand what you are going through. Those closest to you will try to change you, convince you that you are losing your mind. You’re not. You are special. You have been chosen to do something amazing. Know that your struggles will all be worth it in the end because you have a purpose.\n"
"\n"
"You’re going to save the world. \n"
"\n"
"How do I know? I’ve been through this all before, and I’m going to prove it. Below you will find a list of events that will come to pass in the future. They cannot be changed or undone. It will take time for you to accept this, but eventually you will learn to use this knowledge to your advantage. You will be prepared for what is coming. \n"
"\n"
"OCTOBER  3rd, 2000\n"
"Derek Stevenson has been bullying you for months. On October 3rd you will push him down the staircase at school. You’ll do everything in your power to resist this, partly to avoid the consequences, partly to prove this book wrong, but the terrible things he will say in that moment will be too much for you to handle. He’ll pretend to cry, claim that you gave him a concussion, and you’ll take all the blame. \n"
"\n"
"You will be transferred to another school. You’ll hope things will get better. They won’t. It’s going to be a difficult year. Whenever you feel helpless just remember this book. You are special. You have a purpose that they don’t. Hold on to that. \n"
"\n"
"And if it makes you feel better… 16 years from now Derek will be working at a dollar store. He still lives with his mom. \n"
"\n"
"DECEMBER 3rd, 2000\n"
"Mr. Hartsook from next door will pass away. \n"
"\n"
"FEBRUARY 3rd, 2001\n"
"The kids at school will steal your jacket. Your parents will claim that you’re hiding it on purpose so that they will buy you a new one. Look in the bin on the corner of 3rd and Main. You’ll find something that will get you through the winter. You’ll be teased for wearing it by Michelle. You’ll fight back but it will only make things worse. Eventually when you are able to contain your anger, take her aside and say the following to her:\n"
"\n"
"“I’m sorry about your mom.” Then give her a hug. \n"
"\n"
"She will push you away. She will look incredibly confused, vulnerable. She will never tease you again.\n"
"\n"
"APRIL 24th, 2001\n"
"Erica, your best friend, will break her arm. Having read this, you will do everything in your power to prevent this. The actions you take to avoid this from happening will only make it so. This is the first time you will truly witness that your fate is already determined. It cannot be changed. \n"
"\n"
"Erica will blame you for the incident. Try not to take this to heart. You will soon discover that she isn’t the friend you thought she was. Stay strong. You will find people who respect you for who you are very soon.\n"
"\n"
"AUGUST 5th, 2001\n"
"You will take the night bus home. There will be only one other passenger on board – a scruffy-looking kid with a black eye. His name is Jack Joyce. Remember his face. He’s going to become important down the line.\n"
"\n"
"SEPTEMBER 11th, 2001\n"
"This is the one that will change you. \n"
"\n"
"An event will occur that will devastate the entire nation. An act of terrorism will cause the World Trade Centers to collapse. Thousands will die. I won’t go into further detail because the more you know the more painful it will become when you are unable to prevent it. And you WILL try to prevent it. \n"
"\n"
"You will fail. You will curse this book for not telling you more. You will curse yourself for not being able to stop it. It will take a long time to get over this, but eventually you will use this pain to fuel your path forward. You’ve now felt what it is to be completely unprepared for what is coming. It won’t happen again. Next time you will be ready. \n"
"\n"
"This is the event that will finally make you believe. Any doubt you had will disappear. You’re ready to take on this mission.\n"
"\n"
"So what is coming?  \n"
"\n"
"OCTOBER 8th, 2016\n"
"An experiment gone wrong will cause time to break down. This event will be referred to as a “Fracture in time”. The onset of this event cannot be prevented, but the outcome must be. If the Fracture is not stopped then time itself will come to an end. Life on our planet will end. “Saving the world” wasn’t an overstatement. It is your mission. You must stop the Fracture.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"You can pull this off, but to do so you need to follow some simple instructions:\n"
"\n"
"LEARN WHO TO TRUST\n"
"Short answer: Nobody. The less people know about you the safer you will be. From this point forward your mission takes priority over every other aspect of your life. Do not start a relationship of any kind that you aren’t willing to leave behind at a moment’s notice. There is one exception to this rule. We’ll get to that.\n"
"\n"
"KNOW YOUR ENEMY\n"
"Monarch Solutions. They will try to prevent you from achieving your goal. Learn everything you can about them. You will know the best way to achieve this when the time is right. \n"
"\n"
"Monarch is run by a man named Paul Serene. YOU MUST NEVER BE SEEN BY PAUL SERENE. If he discovers you, then you will risk failing your mission. Learn everything you can about him. Remain hidden, but keep in mind that the best place to hide is often in plain sight. \n"
"\n"
"BLEND IN\n"
"Change your appearance frequently – hair color, clothing style, everything. Be cautious about drawing attention to yourself. Learn to blend in. Examine those around you – the way they move, speak, laugh. Copy them. Become your surroundings.\n"
"\n"
"TRAIN DAILY\n"
"There are a series of skills you will need to master to truly be prepared. Hand-to-hand combat –Filipino Kali and Jeet Kune Do. Weapons training – knives, pistols, shotguns, rifles. Wilderness survival. Compartmentalization. Lip reading. Face reading. The list is one that you will build as you go. In time you will understand what is necessary and what isn’t. \n"
"\n"
"Don’t rush yourself. Start with gymnastics.\n"
"\n"
"STUDY YOUR TARGET\n"
"Jack Joyce. He is the one person who can help you in your mission. He is the exception to rule 1. You can trust him. Learn what you can about Jack, study him from afar, but DO NOT APPROACH HIM DIRECTLY. You aren’t the only one watching him. \n"
"\n"
"On October 9th, 2016 you will rescue Jack Joyce. From there the next steps will reveal themselves. Be patient with him. He’s stubborn, reckless, naïve… but you can’t do this without him. And he has his moments. He’s much smarter than he seems at first; don’t mistake grief for stupidity.\n"
"\n"
"STUDY YOUR OBJECTIVE\n"
"The countermeasure. This is the device that was built to stop the Fracture in time. This is your objective. Find the countermeasure and use it to stop the Fracture. Achieve this and the world will be saved. \n"
"\n"
"The device was built by Jack’s brother, Dr. William Joyce. Any attempt to contact William or find the countermeasure before the onset of the Fracture will be in vain. Wait. Jack will show you the way. \n"
"\n"
"Retrieving the countermeasure will not be a simple task. It will involve great hardship and sacrifice. When the time comes you will be ready for this. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"When you first read this it won’t make much sense to you. Over time you will believe every word but you will feel underprepared. You will wish that I had told you everything. I promise you that what is written here is everything you will need in order to get you where you need to be. I know this… \n"
"\n"
"Because I’m already there.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Chin up, Toto. You’re going to achieve amazing things.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

I believe Dr. Amaral switched the date at the last moment. I heard Jack calling out, but it was too late. I was already inside. There was nothing to do but keep moving forward, and when I exited the corridor I arrived in the one place I never thought possible. \n"
"\n"
"The End of Time. \n"
"\n"
"My greatest fear was realized. I’m still trying to grasp what that means. My entire life has been devoted to stopping the Fracture. What I saw… was it proof that it couldn’t be stopped? I can’t believe that. There’s a logic to all of this, a meaning, I just haven’t found it yet. I’m not ready to write down details of the End of Time. Not yet.\n"
"\n"
"The essential part of the story is that I found a way back. I spent a long time trying to fix William’s machine, but somebody beat me to it. He set a course to the earliest time the machine could operate - the first time the core was activated. February 28th, 1999. I followed him through.\n"
"\n"
"That’s when I found William, still alive, much younger than I had ever seen him. I warned him about the Fracture. I told him that he was the only one who could create a solution. He begged me not to tell him anything else about the future. He said he couldn’t stand living like that, being constantly aware of what will come to pass, his every action just part of the preordained dance. I wanted to tell him more. But I know how he felt.\n"
"\n"
"William agreed to do what must be done. He agreed to build the countermeasure. This whole time it was me who set him on that path. \n"
"\n"
"He says the machine doesn’t have the sufficient chronon capacity to return me to the future. He says a jump that far would be nearly impossible without a substantial scientific breakthrough. Apparently that hasn’t happened yet. That’s his way of saying I’m trapped. In 1999. Second time around. \n"
"\n"
"So… here I am. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"July 19th, 1999\n"
"\n"
"TIME MACHINE MOVE = SUCCESS\n"
"\n"
"I worked with Will to get the time machine moved. Had to make sure Serene wouldn’t be able to use it to his advantage, so we moved it to the one place I knew it would be safe. Bradbury Swimming Pool. Will spent a big chunk of his research grant buying the property. It’s the one place I know for sure that Monarch won’t find us. After all, they still weren’t aware of it in 2016. That means this is my new home for the time being. \n"
"\n"
"Will refuses to build the countermeasure here. He says that it has to be done at his workshop. He chose that location to build the time machine for a reason. Something about abnormal chronon density, anomalies, whatever. Didn’t seem to concern him that the very people we need to hide from know about his workshop. Probably doesn’t help that he won’t let me tell him who those people actually are. Guy’s almost as stubborn as his brother. \n"
"\n"
"Now that the move is complete and Will is on his way all I can do is wait. Not liking the idea of that. Keeping busy was the only thing that distracted me from the eerie nature of being trapped here. Guess I should look at the bright side. Second chance at having a killer Y2K party? \n"
"\n"
"September 5, 1999\n"
"\n"
"LITTLE ME\n"
"\n"
"The most surreal experience. Her eyes looked so full of life. Looking to the clouds, invulnerable to the world around her. She looked full of life. She looked happy.\n"
"\n"
"It was me. \n"
"\n"
"I knew the day was coming. I knew that I had to go see her and set her on her mission so that she would do what needed to be done. So that someday she would become, well, me. \n"
"\n"
"She was in the backyard, bright red duffel coat, playing. Simple pleasures. It’s strange, I remember the small details so differently the first time around. When I was a child that woman who came to see me seemed like an angel, a limitless source of wisdom gifting me with purpose. Now I was that woman. Trembling, a lump in my stomach, nervous as hell. It didn’t matter; I knew she was too young to see those things on my face. I gave her the notebook. I told a small child to give up those simple pleasures to pursue a life that would bring nothing but pain and hardship. \n"
"\n"
"I promised her that it would all be worth it, that she would make a difference, that she would save the world. She believed me. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"January 1st, 2000\n"
"\n"
"EPIC Y2K PARTY\n"
"\n"
"Ate bagels with cream cheese and watched Buffy reruns in a drained swimming pool. Party on.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"September 11th, 2001\n"
"\n"
"9/11\n"
"\n"
"I tried to stop it a second time. I warned them. Told them exactly what was going to happen. Nothing changed. \n"
"\n"
"I came to terms with the fact that none of this could be changed as a child. But since then I’ve seen things that make me desperate to prove myself wrong, desperate to believe that what I’ve seen cannot come to pass.  \n"
"\n"
"I tried to stop the rise of Monarch. I tried to stop Paul Serene. Both versions of him. Every action was negated by the force of a timeline that cannot be bent or broken. \n"
"\n"
"I’ve tried to stop tragedy as well. Jack’s parents, Christmas of 1999. I knew what happened to them. This time I was there. Car crashed exactly as it was supposed to. My presence only led it to happen as it always did. \n"
"\n"
"I went to the funeral. I watched Jack cry. I watched Will build up a wall around himself. I watched two brothers change forever in that moment, and I could do nothing about it. \n"
"\n"
"And now this. \n"
"\n"
"Fuck. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"May 22nd, 2002\n"
"\n"
"MONARCH\n"
"\n"
"They spotted me near William’s workshop. Barely got out of there alive. After all this time Serene is still obsessed with finding me. He won’t give up until he does. Have to be more careful in the future. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"May 22nd, 2003\n"
"\n"
"THE END OF TIME\n"
"\n"
"Been having recurring nightmares about what I saw. I’ve been dreading doing this, but it’s time. I have to write it out. It’s the only way to move past it. \n"
"\n"
"In 2016 I entered the time machine, intending to travel back to 2010. That didn’t happen. Dr. Amaral changed the date. When I exited the machine I arrived at the End of Time. \n"
"\n"
"The Fracture had run its course. Time had stopped altogether. The entire world was frozen in one hanging moment. I was the only one still able to function. Or so I thought. Then the shifters came. I can still hear them. Their sounds echo through my dreams. The entire world was still… except me. They really don’t like movement.\n"
"\n"
"I’d stepped out of the machine into the one thing I spent my entire life trying to prevent. The Fracture was never fixed. I was living through the proof. \n"
"\n"
"The first hours were the hardest. I was living through a nightmare that I couldn’t wake up from, surrounded by constant reminders that my mission would fail. Never able to stay in one place because the shifters were always searching, always hunting.\n"
"\n"
"I wasn’t alone. I discovered the first evidence of this a few days in. I heard the shifters become agitated, but I was nowhere near them. They were following somebody else. Paul Serene. A younger Paul. Scared, weak, vulnerable. He found me, tried to convince me that we needed to work together, to help each other through. He found out very quickly that I wanted him dead. He had no training, no killer instinct. But he had those damn powers, and all I had was the chronon harness.\n"
"\n"
"The end of the world, the only two people left, and we became sworn enemies. I can’t be sure how long we spent there. It could have been months, could have been years. When time doesn’t move it feels like an eternity. Our grip on reality slipped away, trapped in an endless loop of brutal survival. Though we were enemies there was a strange bond formulated through that suffering. We’ve shared an experience that no other human has ever endured.\n"
"\n"
"Eventually Paul managed to get William’s time machine working. He was convinced that he needed to travel back to the earliest possible point in order to stop this all from happening. He had yet to learn that the past couldn’t be changed. I followed him through the machine but he escaped. He formed Monarch. He built an empire. \n"
"\n"
"I watched the birth of a monster. I can’t escape the feeling that my actions helped shape what he became. Maybe I could have guided him. Maybe if I hadn’t tried to hunt him down and kill him at the End of Time. That can’t be my part in all of this. There has to be more. \n"
"\n"
"I wake up in a cold sweat most nights. I hear the shifters coming. I can almost feel their presence. \n"
"\n"
"Much of my experience at the End of Time has become a blur in my memory, but there is one detail that I can’t shake. One detail that brings my entire mission into question. One detail that haunts me. \n"
"\n"
"2021. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"February 3rd, 2005\n"
"\n"
"HOBBIES\n"
"\n"
"Five years until the countermeasure will be complete. I spend most of my days training. I don’t know what happens once the device is finished, but being prepared is my specialty. I still wonder if Jack will follow the plan, if he’ll emerge from that machine in 2010. Best not to think about it. I’m not giving up, but I can’t let these thoughts consume me. I need to focus on the present, focus on what is in front of me. That’s the mantra that keeps me going – just focus on the present.\n"
"\n"
"So I decided to take on some hobbies. Tried poetry. Got depressed. Dabbled with a guitar for a while. Smashed it against the wall. Then I started experimenting with graffiti. Seems to be working out okay for me so far. It’s fulfilling on a few different levels. Partly as a form of self-expression, partly as a means of release, partly just to fuck with people. What happens when Joe analyzes some graffiti on a wall one day, builds an interpretation in his head, and then three years later his depiction of that image comes true? Not sure, but it’s fun to think about. I can’t change anything, but at least this gives me the illusion of some kind of power. That illusion is what keeps me holding on.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes I leave anonymous notes in people’s mail boxes telling them what will happen next week. I watch their reactions from afar. Voyeurism and graffiti. That’s my life these days. \n"
"\n"
"Focus on the present. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"October 8th, 2007\n"
"\n"
"JACK\n"
"\n"
"I started watching him recently. I know Monarch is tracking him so I keep my distance. I wasn’t sure why I felt a need to follow him, to watch his life from the outside, but now I think I understand. I met Jack in the wake of his brother’s death, the onset of the Fracture. Worst day of both of our lives. He was broken. That’s the only Jack I ever knew. There’s some kind of comfort in seeing him in happier times. \n"
"\n"
"I watched his band play a gig nearby. Atrociously bad. Whiny emo music. Definitely a music movement I didn’t need to live through a second time, but there was something pure about seeing him up there, letting it all out. He never had an easy life. It was nice to see that he found a way to release all that. He just looked… happy. It made me forget everything else.\n"
"\n"
"The nightmares stopped for a while after that. So I kept following him. It gave me something else to focus on. \n"
"\n"
"I’ve spent most of my life hiding who I am, what I know. I knew Jack for less than 24 hours, but he’s the only person I’ve opened up to about everything. I told him the truth. He believed me. I wish I could thank him for that. \n"
"\n"
"I’m not sure what I’m going to tell him if he comes through that machine on July 4th, 2010. What will he think when he sees me? 11 years will have passed. I look like I’ve aged three lifetimes since then. And for him it could only be a matter of minutes. \n"
"\n"
"What do I say? That I saw the end? That this might all be for nothing? I was the one who believed without question that we would stop the Fracture. That confidence has now been replaced with insecurity, weakness. I fear letting him see that. I fear that he’ll see the doubt in my eyes. For years I felt invincible, full of hope. I’m not that woman anymore. \n"
"\n"
"I’m scared. \n"
"\n"
"December 11th, 2007\n"
"\n"
"MEMORY\n"
"\n"
"Tonight I painted something at the university campus. It was only after I was finished and took a step back to look at it that I realized I’ve seen it before, about a decade ago, remains of something painted on a wall but washed away. It was a jolt. Is all of this futile? Nothing sticks. Nothing is changed. All of it washed away by the river of time.\n"
"\n"
"Fucking time travel.\n"
"\n"
"July 9th, 2008\n"
"\n"
"WILL\n"
"\n"
"I’ve been in contact with Will every six months or so. Short exchanges just to get an update on his progress building the countermeasure. He’s still at least two years away from completion, but he’s now confident that he knows how the countermeasure will work. \n"
"\n"
"He told me that the countermeasure will be able to reverse a Fracture in time, but in order to do so it must be activated early in the escalation of the Fracture. Once the Fracture runs its course, once the End of Time is reached, he believes the countermeasure will be rendered ineffective. \n"
"\n"
"I asked him what it would mean if the End of Time ever occurred. He said it would mean that the Fracture was never stopped. \n"
"\n"
"It would mean that we failed.\n"
"\n"
"July 21st, 2008\n"
"\n"
"Everything I have done has been for nothing. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"July 4th, 2010\n"
"\n"
"FINAL ENTRY\n"
"\n"
"The day is here. Soon I will receive word that William has completed the countermeasure. I’m sure of it. I’ve come to accept that this doesn’t mean we will succeed. I’ve come to accept that my mission was a lie. \n"
"\n"
"But I’m not giving up. Lie or not, I devoted my life to this cause. It gave me meaning. It’s all I’ve ever known. Even if I’ve seen the proof that I won’t succeed, I’m not giving up. I will dedicate every ounce of courage I have left to seeing this through. I’ll retrieve the countermeasure. I’ll keep it safe until 2016. I will do everything in my power to activate it when the time comes. I will fail. But I will fail knowing that I did everything in my power to save the world. \n"
"\n"
"For years I hoped that this would be the day when I would see Jack again. I’ve given up that hope. This mission started with me alone. That’s how it will end. \n"
"\n"
"This will be my final entry."

"Jack came to see me. He found out that I sold our parents’ house to continue funding my research. Understandably, he was furious. After all, the house was left to both of us.

I was talking to Clarice and I didn’t realize this before, I thought he was just sneaky or lucky or something, but I saw some battle reports from the field and he’s just a machine, fucker just shoots his way through everything we throw his way!!!! I know this place is safe but I figure he’ll show up sooner or later. I heard he’s got some personal beef with Serene. So when he comes you better stay out of his way. Let the jarheads handle that! If they can!! If Joyce is coming after Serene, he’s gonna be pretty mad when he finds out the boss took a chopper out (you hear anything about that, what the fuck was that about??). so it could get pretty ugly.\n"

"THE LIFEBOAT SECURITY PROTOCOLS ARE NOW IN FULL EFFECT.\n"
"\n"
"Our stutterproofing has failed, and we have reports of shifters in the building.\n"
"\n"
"You all know the drill, we have trained for this. DO NOT APPROACH SHIFTERS ALONE. Remember that they are not restricted by the physical space in the same way we are. Deploy dampeners and watch your backs. Work in teams, remember your tactics, MAINTAIN YOUR DISTANCE. Don’t take any unnecessary chances.\n"
"\n"
"Comms are unreliable due to the stutters, so pass the word to others, and take advantage of stutter collapses to communicate as effectively as you can. We are attempting to repair the stutterproofing as quickly as possible, but be advised that contrary to our earlier timeline, which gave us years more to prepare, we believe we are now on the verge of the final zero state, and every single stutter we encounter is more and more likely to be the one that never ends. That means our priorities have changed: the Lifeboat Protocol is in full effect, and ensuring its success is our only objective, whether the opposition is shifters, Jack Joyce, or anybody else.\n"
"\n"
"It’s vital that we all remember our training – if we do things right, we WILL make it out of this, and we WILL make our way into the Lifeboat.\n"

"REFLECTIONS ON THE END\n"
"\n"
"I wish my memories about the End of Time were clearer, but it was anything but a clear time in my life – and the world was such a jumble, a frozen mess of different timelines crashing together. I was running for my life the whole time, trying to avoid the Shifters. Not an ideal state of mind for gathering intel.\n"
"\n"
"And it didn’t help that she kept chasing me, trying to kill me. Beth Wilder. One of my own people. It was her all along. Even then, trapped in the End of Time, as little as I understood about what was going on, I could tell she wasn’t like me – that she didn’t have the powers I did. I knew she had some kind of technology that kept her going in that suspended hell.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, I had no idea it was a device I would eventually have my people develop. I suppose I should appreciate the irony that it was her chronon harness – my own chronon harness – that it gave me the idea for the Lifeboat protocol. The idea that our technology could let humanity survive the End of Time. I suppose I have to thank her for that. And she paid for her sins, in the end… but she left her mark on me. I know the time to pay for mine is approaching quickly. But not just yet.\n"
"\n"
"Back then, when Wilder and I played our game of cat and mouse at the End of Time, if I’d had an ounce of the control over my powers that I do now, things would have turned out very differently between the two of us. She was strong and had the training, and I was young and weak and scared. Even so, my abilities gave me an edge. I was lucky she didn’t have the full Striker gear.\n"
"\n"
"She was the one with the upper hand. I didn’t learn to learn to properly control my abilities until much later. In those days, they were unpredictable and operated on instinct. Control didn’t come easy. I can’t help but be aware that this doesn’t seem to be the case for Jack. His mastery is growing by leaps and bounds. Is it just because that’s the way he’s always been? Fast on his feet. Bold and adaptive. Or is the Fracture affecting him, too?\n"
"\n"
"I thought we could contain him. It’s cost us dearly.\n"

"I’m sorry THERE ARE NOW DEAD PEOPLE at my feet and I don’t know how to fucking deal with this!!! They’re Strikers. They weren’t here when I started writing this e-mail, and now they are. There’s a lot of blood. I literally had to wipe it off the screen just to be able to keep typing. It had to be a Shifter that killed them. Their chronon harnesses are broken. I couldn’t wear them if I wanted.\n"
"\n"
"But without one, I’m safe, right? No Shifters outside of stutters, or that’s what they told us in training. So I’m safe, and when a stutter hits, I don’t even notice. Unless a plane hits the building or something.\n"
"\n"
"God, I have fucked up so badly. People are dead because of me, not just these two, but throughout the building. The stutterproofing was supposed to keep the Shifters out, and now… everybody must be dying, somewhere between the seconds. Everybody could be dead already, I don’t know. I can’t take this.\n"
"\n"
"And don’t trust Hatch. I think that son of a bitch is after the CFR. I think he was never on our side. This is all some kind of a weird game to him. Shit, I don’t know why he’s doing this. I’m just an engineer, and I don’t know how to deal with this. It’s too much. Sir, I know you must be furious at me. I deserve it. Believe me, I know. But please don’t take it out on my family.\n"

"I have left this message here for you to find, so that soon, when the time comes, and I ask you to choose, you can do so with your eyes open and with some hint of understanding. I have no secrets, and the only things I choose to omit are the ones that you, in your current limited state, would not be able to grasp no matter how hard I tried to make you understand.\n"
" \n"
"I have walked down the same path you are now on. Once – from your perspective, a long time ago, although time no longer has such meaning to me – I too came in contact with a time machine. In my case, it was not a manmade device, but a natural one, in a cave. It should come as no surprise, really, that such things exist, much like natural nuclear reactors do exist, such as the now defunct ones at Oklo, Africa. After all, the Meyer-Joyce field has its irregularities. I too became chronon active. I too developed Chronon Syndrome. And in time, I too lost control and became a shifter, became at once everything and nothing, was everywhere and nowhere, died countless deaths and was still alive, my every probability, every possibility happening at once.\n"
" \n"
"I promised I would not lie, and thus I tell you: the noise and the pain and the rage were more than anyone could suffer and not go insane. I burned in this fire for a long time. There were brief moments of awareness in this endless nightmare – different versions of certain key moments in my life that I found myself reliving again and again. Trying to make things right. Like a puzzle. On and on and on.\n"
" \n"
"I am convinced that the stutters and the End of Time saved me. For those were the only places, the only times, where I could even briefly stop and rest and slowly find focus and control again, and ultimately master this state – not emerge from it, not be cured, not go back to what I was before, for there is no such thing, but to learn to be in one place and everywhere at once. My perception is altered, like that of someone who has seen a perceptual illusion, and discovered that the picture is both a young girl and an old woman at the same time. Once you see them both, you can never not see them. We are such limited beings, we play with just one piece, on just one square on an endless chessboard, just one life, one timeline, in an infinite multiverse of possibilities. Am I an exception? The only one who has found his way to the other side? Or is this just a shifter’s brief dream before a stutter collapses?\n"
"\n"
"There are other shifters. You. Your best friend who is now your mortal enemy. Dr. Kim. Others, some of whom you know. It doesn’t matter who, because they are gone, and when they emerge, if they ever emerge, they will not be who they were, just as I am not who I was before. I have done my part in helping you all achieve this state.\n"
"\n"
"If time is an ocean with a frozen surface, then the stutters and the End of Time are holes in that ice. Opportunities to come up for air.\n"
" \n"
"I have a plan. It’s already in motion. But it would be futile to try to explain it to you, like trying to explain three dimensions to someone who can only see one. But make no mistake; I do not look down on you. I strive for humility even as I shift this world from one state to another. I will make this possible. I stand in between. I don’t see myself as a gate. I remain humble. I’m something smaller. A hatch."

"I have initiated the Lifeboat Protocol over Martin’s objections; given how things have developed since then, I’m glad I did. I don’t fully understand Martin’s motives, but it’s obvious he’s moving against me, and against the entire survival plan itself. I know you have worked closely with him, and I know that this must come as a shock.\n"
"\n"
"It’s also alarming that in evading capture, Martin took out an entire security team. For an unarmed man who’s ostensibly not combat trained, that should be impossible. Obviously, this is highly alarming news. I don’t know if he had help, or if there’s even more to Martin than we have come to suspect, but he’s had free rein over this company for a long time, and he’s extremely resourceful – and persuasive. It’s not clear to me who I can trust at this point. \n"

My foreknowledge of future events will end very soon, and it might prove to be useful to have the option of obtaining more detailed information from the future. (Obviously, given that the furthest you could go back is the machine’s activation at the university, visiting the past seems fairly useless.) \n"
"\n"
"Also, ensure that the machine is heavily guarded at all times. Nobody is allowed to operate the machine besides myself, and I want the corridor to remain undeployed unless I give specific orders to the contrary.\n"
"\n"
"As for the Joyce brothers…\n"
"\n"
"I intend to give William the option of joining us, if possible, but I know him. He’s a very stubborn and unstable man, and I don’t know if we could ever trust him. I don’t need to remind you that he built, in that ridiculous little workshop, with very limited resources, a device that broke the local physics at Ground Zero, and caused my Chronon Syndrome. I don’t intend to give him a chance to show us what else he could do if he decides that we’re a target. That, along with the visions I have seen… there are certain sentimental reasons that make me wish I could let William live, but I doubt that he makes it possible for us.\n"
"\n"
"As for Jack, I’m not too worried about him. It took me a long time to master my abilities, so Jack shouldn’t be a major problem unless he manages to use stutters to escape the area – luckily, stutters should be very rare in these early stages of the Fracture. Still, I’ve come too far to take any chances. I’d prefer to take him alive, but nothing can be allowed to put our plan at risk.\n"
"\n"
"I’m sorry to have to involve you in something like this; I know it’s not what you signed up for, and as I said, I don’t expect you to be personally involved with that part of the operation in any way. I’m not particularly happy about this part myself, and I wish I had better options. But our circumstances are as they are, and I have come too far to falter now. I hope you understand.\n"

"DATE: OCT 7, 2016 – 1:01pm\n"
"SUBJECT: Time machine core\n"
"\n"
"Paul,\n"
"\n"
"We now have finalized the plans for acquiring and transporting the time machine core from the university lab. Your instructions are quite clear: we won’t actually move in until your younger self has entered the machine, and the men will try to take the Joyces alive, with the understanding that Jack Joyce in particular could be a threat, and neither can be allowed to escape under any circumstances. \n"
"\n"
"I’m still quite uncomfortable with all this, Paul. I understand your reasoning, and I know the stakes are high, but I don’t want to see anybody hurt. It’s antithetical to my role as a scientist, and I wish you’d reconsider. Surely there’s a better way to resolve this; moral implications aside, the loss of Dr. Joyce’s expertise alone would be a great blow.\n"
"\n"
"If everything goes smoothly and quietly, we will transport the core directly to the Monarch tower via ground route; if there’s commotion and it seems there’s any risk of detection, we will instead airlift the core to our drydocks operation, and then move it discreetly from there to the HQ.\n"
"\n"
"The construction of the new time machine frame at the top of the Monarch tower has been finished since last year. Once we have received the core, it will be installed into the time machine, per your orders. I know you don’t intend to use it, but even with the limitations the nature of time travel imposes on us, I have to say it seems like a great waste to not take advantage of such a resource, both from a strategic and a scientific point of view.\n"

"October 9th, 2016, 2:31pm\n"
"\n"
"I find myself at a loss.\n"
"\n"
"We knew that the Fracture would arrive. It was clear very quickly that the process was occurring much faster than Paul’s projections – his experiences – had led us to believe. That was alarming in itself, but there’s another concern: with the Fracture, Paul’s condition seems to be accelerating rapidly. I don’t know what to do about either one of these issues.\n"
"\n"
"I haven’t had a chance to examine Paul properly, and of course he won’t consent to any real tests at this point. He won’t take the time, not with the situation being as critical as it is. He has to prepare for the gala. To take care of every little stupid thing Martin trots out for him. He won’t think of himself at all, and I’m afraid that’ll cost us dearly.\n"
"\n"
"So I don’t know, I’m just speculating, but I believe this acceleration is a reaction to the stutters in time; in zero state, his wave function is further disrupted by the excessive chronon energies within his body. Before the university incident, before the Fracture, the condition was progressive, but controllable. The lack of stutters helped keep it in check. Now, it’s progress is rampant, and I worry that it may reach a critical point soon. We always knew that was a possibility, but all of our projections assumed we would have years – time enough to come up with a cure. Or a way to stop its progress.\n"
"\n"
"Which means there’s a very real chance that in the near future, Paul’s condition overtakes him. And if he does become a Shifter, I don’t know what to do about it. We haven’t been able to help Dr. Kim; I don’t know what we could do for Paul.\n"
"\n"
"I don’t know what to do. The treatments are still working, but they take a toll on him, and their effect is greatly diminished. I’m concerned we may hit a point where he’s forced to use them so often that the treatment becomes worse than the condition itself. And yet, I don’t see any other options. He will not rest. He insists on doing so much. I know he chafes under his dependence on the treatments. He sees it as a weakness.\n"
"\n"
"I’m afraid I may lose him."

"Please be advised that we are now at a point where Lifeboat activation may occur. Accordingly, I have ensured that preparations are underway for activation. As a part of that, what chronon particle stores still remain at the Ground Zero harvesting operation are being moved to the headquarters and placed into the master chronon particle repository, ready to be placed under the CFR’s control.\n"
"\n"
"Please be aware that what we have managed to accumulate until this point is very likely to be all the chronon particles we ever have access to. Due to the Fracture’s effects on the Meyer-Joyce field, the Ground Zero anomaly is showing definite signs of weakening. As a result, the chronon particle yield decreases drastically, and will soon drop to baseline. While we will obviously continue more traditional chronon particle harvesting operations in order to maximize our stockpile, we all need to recognize that sourcing them outside of the Ground Zero conditions is extremely inefficient. Or, in plain terms: unless we find another source of chronon particles – and I don’t believe we will – what we have now is all we will ever have.\n"
"\n"
"Please be aware that all use of chronon technology eats into our limited resources, and while we of course recognize that we need to have our Strikers and other soldiers operate in stutters, each operation undertaken will eat away at our stockpile, and, in very real terms, cost us days of Lifeboat runtime. Accordingly, we have to plan all use of this technology closely and choose our battles carefully.\n"
"\n"
"That said, we should also realize the ongoing situation with Jack Joyce constitutes an emergency, and will most likely require unconventional chronon particle investments. Just the same, we should be aware of the cost.\n"
"\n"
"I expect to see projected chronon particle consumption rates for the foreseeable future and simulations of how long our stockpile will last, adjusted for all of the scenarios we have discussed (see our last meeting minutes), in our next Monday Meeting.\n"

"Because there seems to be a certain lack of clarity about when it’s appropriate for someone to enter the CFR Chamber and mess with the Chronon Field Regulator, and because I just had to fire Kevin Janeway because he did that exact thing, let me remind you of the approved CFR procedure:\n"
"\n"
"YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE CFR.\n"
"\n"
"PERIOD.\n"
"\n"
"I may touch the CFR, because I’m the lead technician in charge of it. Dr. Sofia Amaral may touch the CFR, because she’s our head of research and she knows what she’s doing. Mr. Paul Serene may touch the CFR, because he’s Paul fucking Serene, and it’s his CFR.\n"
"\n"
"NOBODY ELSE TOUCHES THE CFR.\n"
"\n"
"On occasion, some enormously lucky individuals who have been personally trained by me and are proven to be very, very dependable and incredibly good at their jobs, who don’t have a track record of trying to enter the CFR chamber like paint-huffing imbeciles because “they just wanted to take a closer look at it,” and who have remembered to bribe the lead technician in charge of the CFR with Tom Waits tickets, may be given written instructions to perform specific procedures on the CFR. That will be a great honor and a sign of a significant degree of trust, and those people should be accorded all professional respect and an appropriate degree of brownnosing and/or passive-aggressive displays of envy by their peers.\n"
"\n"
"Or, to put it another way, YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE CFR unless you want to join Kevin in the “how to stop being an arrogant dumb shit who jeopardized the only hope of a future for the entire human race because his mansplaining ass thought what the CFR really needed was a random dude Who Knew Better” self-improvement course down at the unemployment office, which I’m sure is where we all believe he was escorted to by those armed men.\n"
"\n"
"There are no exceptions to this. The entire Lifeboat Protocol depends on the CFR being present, properly connected and functioning normally. You do not want to jeopardize this. This is bigger than any of us, and we are not here to fuck around.\n"

"PERSONAL NOTES ON THE CFR\n"
"January 5, 2011\n"
"Dr. Henry Kim\n"
"\n"
"This thing feels like a conundrum wrapped in a puzzle. It’s an incredible piece of technology, and I feel like we’re only scratching the surface of what it can do – and we have already learned so much. I thought I had a good understanding of the intricacies of chronon particles and their practical applications before. Now I realize that I’ve still got a great deal to learn.\n"
"\n"
"The Chronon Field Regulator, as I’ve decided to call it, is a little miracle. How such a small device can do so much is beyond me. I know it taps into the Meyer-Joyce field, but I don’t know how; my experiments just show it can do it. It can also manipulate the field. I wish I knew how. Still, the mechanics of its operation give me ideas – new avenues of thought I’ve been trying to find for such a long time.\n"
"\n"
"The task that I’ve been set by Mr. Serene has, frankly, stumped me for years. Knowing that what we observe as the passage of time is just the result of chronon particles being constantly generated within the Meyer-Joyce field is a simple fact that I’ve been aware of for a long time. But being able to manipulate those particles in a meaningful way – well, that’s another question.\n"
"\n"
"The mechanics of the situation are clear, almost frustratingly so. In a zero state environment, there are no chronon particles, and thus time is frozen. The idea of artificially flooding an area with chronon particles to enable the passage of time is the obvious solution. But actually finding a way of doing that… that’s something else. Not only are chronon particles incredibly difficult to source, so obtaining enough to actually “stutterproof” an area for any time longer than a fraction of a second has always seemed impossible. Perhaps even more importantly, the mechanism of manipulating the particles in a way that would actually allow me to define a certain volume of space as “stutterproofed” has constantly eluded me.\n"
"\n"
"Well, Ground Zero has solved the former problem for us: we’re almost up and running, and very soon we will have the ability to harvest chronon particles at useful rates. We’ll be able to build a truly formidable stockpile of them in the years to come. As for the latter problem, manipulating the chronon particles  – that seems to be something the CFR does with ease. Its ability to tap into the Meyer-Joyce field and effect changes in its topology is exactly what I need.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, I don’t know how it does it. I don’t have a clue. And I don’t know how to effectively control these effects. But my research into the practical effects of its operation has given me ideas for a different kind of chronon technology that works on a somewhat similar principle – except instead of tapping into the Meyer-Joyce field, it generates a similar, localized field of its own – an artificial chronon particle field. And within that field, we can manipulate chronon particles at will. This means that we should be able to create “stutterproofing” technology, allowing us to shield a certain area from the effects of zero state, and I believe I will be able to miniaturize the technology to allow for personalized devices with the same effect – almost like an environmental suit of sorts, with a harness the user would wear to create a chronon field around his body.\n"
"\n"
"There are still many challenges here, one of which is that the any significant volume of stutterproofed space will incur an unacceptably high drain on chronon particles, which are a decidedly limited resource. Obviously, with the Lifeboat Protocol requiring a large stutterproofed area that we can maintain for years, quite possibly decades, this is a critical issue we have to solve, and Mr. Serene has made that quite clear to me. Frankly, even with Mr. Hatch backing me, the thought of disappointing Serene over this makes me quite anxious. I understand his concerns, and they are of course entirely founded, but the man’s intensity is unnerving.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, I’m hopeful that I will figure out this problem soon. I’m hoping to be able to use the CFR itself to regulate the flow of chronon particles; given its nature, I suspect it might be eminently suitable for such a role in the Lifeboat project and cut down our chronon consumption rate by a great margin. My control over the CFR is limited, but this seems to be a very basic functionality for it, so I’m optimistic that I can do it.\n"
"\n"
"I’m still looking into it. One thing at a time; we’ve already made great progress, and I will say that Mr. Serene’s been quite complimentary with these successes, so I think he’ll give us the time we need. (Well, it’s not like he has a lot of choice in the matter.)\n"
"\n"
"I’ll be honest: the CFR is becoming a bit of an obsession for me. I wish I could sit down and have that conversation and just ask those questions: how did he build it? What it’s actually for? But I’ve been denied that opportunity. A part of me wants to open the CFR up and get to the bottom of it – but the potential consequences terrify me; we’ve already seen what it can do if unleashed. Even worse, there’s the possibility that I couldn’t put it back together, and just the idea of making a mistake like that is a positively bowel-liquefying thought. Having to explain that to Mr. Serene… No, thank you.\n"
"\n"
"So, as it is, I have only dared to open up a bit of the casing to get a rough idea of some of the engineering inside. It’s amazing work, and it has certainly been a lesson in humility for me. I still have a lot to learn – but I’m a very fast learner, and this has to be the most important work anyone has ever engaged in in the history of humanity. If we succeed in our mission, the world will not soon forget the name of Dr. Henry Kim."

"\n"
"I know you’ve both been arguing that the Quantum Ripple Causality Research Subdivision has great potential, and we should keep it funded. I must once again implore you to reconsider.\n"
"\n"
"I’ll be the first one to admit that the technology is impressive. The fact that Drs. Morfin and Rangers can actually track the consequences rippling out from minor shifts within the Meyer-Joyce field is incredible, and the level of informational detail they manage to obtain is amazing. But here’s the thing: they’ve been at this for two years now, and they have not produced a single useful result.\n"
"\n"
"Yes, we can trace actual events from their small inception point to the actual consequences, very much in keeping with the basic chaos theory concept of the butterfly flapping its wings, but, well – so what? Every single thing that happens in this universe is the result of such a chain of events. Being able to see the chain offers no real insight to anything due to the very randomness of the process. Furthermore, it’s utterly misleading – you could say that some tiny event or tiny decision in my life yesterday led me to writing this e-mail, and that’s technically true, but so did some tiny event or tiny decision in my life fifteen years ago – it’s all a chain; the event yesterday didn’t take place in a vacuum. It didn’t come out of nowhere. So what’s the point? We have no control over it, we don’t get to direct it, and we get no useful information out of it.\n"
"\n"
"Also, have you actually seen the reports they generate? From a technological point of view, the way they manage to automate their analysis of the fluctuation signatures within the Meyer-Joyce field is impressive, but again, it’s all meaningless babble with no practical applications. Their personal remarks on the reports are even worse. With all due respect to Ron and Terry and their indisputable technical expertise, I don’t know what they’re doing, and I’m not sure they do, either. It’s like they’re coming up with stuff at random.\n"
"\n"
"The above outlines my concerns as to the futility of the entire process, and I suspect that may not be enough to sway you – but I have one final point, which I think you should consider very, very carefully.\n"
"\n"
"The entire program is an unforgivable waste of Monarch resources. I don’t mean money, although the entire Quantum Ripple Causality Reserach Subdivision is costing us millions and millions of dollars – but that doesn’t really matter, because I know we can afford that. However, there’s a more vital resource they’re consuming; each time they fire up their rig and delve into the Meyer-Joyce field, they eat up a huge amount of chronon particles. Those are a finite resource, and as you know, we are projecting that the Ground Zero’s yield will rapidly diminish as the Fracture takes hold – which will happen very soon. You may not understand what the real impact of this is, so let me put it to you in practical terms: every single time they detect and analyze a quantum ripple, it costs us a week of potential Lifeboat runtime, minimum. Given Monarch’s primary purpose and the total lack of useful results, I believe that’s a luxury we cannot afford.\n"
"\n"
"I recommend shutting them down immediately, or at the latest, during our next reorg. We can reallocate their resources to something useful, and put Ron and Terri’s expertise into great use designing the Lifeboat. I’m sure we wouldn’t regret putting them to work on that, given their track record of working with chronon tech.\n"

"\n"
"First of all, my condolences and apologies. I didn’t realize you had a history with Henry, and frankly, I would not have promoted you into this position had I known. If you would be more comfortable working on something else, I can make that happen, no questions asked. (To be clear, I’m not talking about a demotion, I mean a comparable senior position in another department.)\n"
"\n"
"You’re correct in that it’s a very sensitive topic, but given your current security clearance, I can tell you what I know. Unfortunately, I don’t know much. For the past six months, I myself have been trying to work out what happened, but I haven’t made much progress. I know Henry was working late in his lab, and there was some kind of a chronon particle surge. Of course, we know that exposure to large quantities of chronon particles can result in physical changes. Paul Serene is an example of that – his first exposure resulted in his extraordinary abilities, and the second exposure caused his progressive condition. In Henry’s case, that exposure transformed him into a Chronon Disrupted Wave Function Subject, or a Shifter. It is of course clear that Mr. Serene’s and Henry’s conditions are essentially the same thing, even if Mr. Serene’s case hasn’t progressed as far.\n"
"\n"
"However, it’s not at all clear how Henry could have been exposed to such a powerful dose of chronon particles, particularly as the lab area itself underwent none of the temporal changes we have come to associate with such an exceptional event. None of the containers on scene had remotely enough chronon particle capacity for such a high dose, and furthermore, all of them were intact and accounted for. In short, we don’t know where these particles could possibly have come from.\n"
"\n"
"I’m not surprised that Martin Hatch was unwilling to discuss this. He was the only other person present in the lab when the accident took place, but I don’t know why he was there or what happened, and he claims to have no memory of the events. Despite this, Martin somehow managed to contain Henry in the artificial zero state field set up in the lab.\n"
"\n"
"I am unwilling to speculate as to how this could possibly have happened. Suffice to say that I have many questions about these events myself.\n"
"\n"
"Think about my offer, Erica. You’re a first-rate scientist and I would hate to lose you, but I would absolutely understand if you wanted to change departments.\n"

Unfortunately, when I moved down to Florida, we didn’t manage to stay in touch. Let’s just say that life took me into unexpected directions. It was a very welcome surprise to hear from him when he was recruiting new people, and I’m glad to say we hit it off again. We spoke on the phone a lot, he came over to meet my wife, and, well, it was like old times. (It could’ve been awkward, but it wasn’t. Henry was like that.)\n"
"\n"
"You can imagine my shock and disappointment when I heard about his death just a week before my own employment at Monarch began – we didn’t get to work together the way I’d hoped. Now, Monarch has been very good to me, but his death has been eating at me. I know it’s something people don’t want to discuss, and I understand that there are confidentiality issues. However, having recently been cleared for some of the more sensitive chronon research, I now know that the story of his death is a fabrication, and Henry has become something entirely different. I’m not blaming anybody, but for my own peace of mind or sense of closure, I suppose, I’m wondering if, given my new security clearance, you are in a position to explain how this came to pass. \n"
"\n"
"I should add that I brought this up with Martin Hatch the other day, and he made it clear in no uncertain terms that I should drop the matter. Given that, I’m taking something of a chance talking to you about this, but I feel like I can’t let this go. I’ll understand if you aren’t allowed to discuss it, but I’m more than a little scared and upset. I hope I can rely on your discretion either way.\n"

"I just heard that you ordered Mr. Hatch arrested. I understand that there appears to be damning evidence against him, but at the risk of offering my opinion where it’s not wanted, I ask you to reconsider the situation.\n"
"\n"
"As Mr. Hatch has repeatedly said, there are people working against you within Monarch, and I believe he’s right. I don’t know who they are, obviously, but I believe that Mr. Hatch's attempts to expose them have made him a target. I’m sure you can see what I mean: it seems very convenient that just as Mr. Hatch has been trying to convince you that there are people you can’t trust within Monarch, your treatments are destroyed, and he is implicated. Looking at this from the POV of an actual traitor, I can’t think of a better way to get rid of a threat, strike against you AND allay suspicion, all in one bold move.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously, sir, I trust your judgment, and you know I have the highest respect for you. I don’t mean to second-guess you. Still, I’m afraid that you are being manipulated. Martin Hatch is not your enemy."

"The activation of the Lifeboat strikes me as a prudent measure, and I’m glad we’re not taking any chances on that front. However, having discussed the matter with Mr. Hatch, I’m increasingly worried about Dr. Amaral’s motives. We know that she was involved in the explosion at the treatment lab.\n"
"\n"
"The thing is, she’s intelligent and resourceful, but that explosion wasn’t something a clever scientist whipped up all by her lonesome. The lab was blown up with military grade explosives sourced from our armory – an armory she doesn’t have access to – and they weren’t just thrown in at random. Somebody with a solid understanding of structural weaknesses and demolition expertise set them up. That’s military training. So we know she had competent help. That means she’s not working alone. Clearly, Dr. Amaral is connected to Joyce, or she wouldn’t have been “kidnapped” – that had to be her exit strategy; she had to know that we’d trace the lab explosion to her – but that’s not our only concern. We have to try to figure out who she was working with on our end.\n"
"\n"
"I know her betrayal hurt you personally in more ways than one, and this may not be the easiest time to start looking into this. I hope you know that I’m at your disposal, whatever you need done. I want to get to the bottom of this."
