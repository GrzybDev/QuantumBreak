00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:00,363


2
00:00:01,363 --> 00:00:03,297
-TIME IS BREAKING DOWN.

3
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:05,627
MONARCH HAS BEEN PREPARING FOR IT.

4
00:00:05,627 --> 00:00:07,165
THERE'S THIS THING.

5
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:11,693
IT'S CALLED THE LIFEBOAT PROTOCOL, AND IT CAN SAVE US -- AT LEAST SOME OF US.

6
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:17,231
-YOU'VE BEEN THE FACE OF MONARCH FOR ALL THESE YEARS, MARTIN, BUT LET'S GET CLEAR ON SOMETHING.

7
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,363
THIS IS STILL MY SHIP.

8
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,759
-YOU'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY. YOU NEED YOUR TREATMENT.

9
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,231
-YOU GONNA GO?

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,561
-ME? GO TO A PARTY?

11
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,660
-WE CAN ROLL TOGETHER IF YOU WANT.

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,429
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,759
-I WANT A STATEMENT.

14
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:31,495
-OUR GROUP TOOK THINGS TOO FAR.

15
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,660
THINGS GOT VERY VIOLENT.

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,396
AND THAT VIOLENCE WAS BECAUSE OF JACK JOYCE.

17
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:40,693
-WE JUST LOST COMMUNICATION WITH JACK JOYCE'S TRANSPO'.

18
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:42,066
FIND HIM.

19
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:44,363
-STEP AWAY! RIGHT NOW!

20
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:47,297
-LIAM, THIS ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

21
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,528
NO. NO!

22
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:51,297
HE'S GONE.

23
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,759
-WE NEED ALL POINTS CONVERGED ON LIAM BURKE.

24
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,396
HE'S ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

25
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:05,297
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

26
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:05,297
